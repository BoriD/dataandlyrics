Streaming provides consumers with low cost, easy access to a wide range of music, while it provides music creators with low cost, easy access to a potentially wide audience. But many creators are unhappy about the major streaming platforms. They consider that they act in an unfair way, create an unlevel playing field and threaten long-term creativity in the music industry.\nOur paper describes and assesses the basis for one element of these concerns, competition between recordings on streaming platforms. We argue that fair competition is restricted by the nature of the remuneration arrangements between creators and the streaming platforms, the role of playlists, and the strong negotiating power of the major labels. It concludes that urgent consideration should be given to a user-centric payment system, as well as greater transparency of the factors underpinning playlist creation and of negotiated agreements.\nYou can read the entire issue and the full text of our article on Competition Policy International in pdf.\n","date":1614108180,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614194580,"objectID":"4c51178c81835af9e29c60bf9a8a4ce4","permalink":"/post/2021-02-24-music-level-playing-field/","publishdate":"2021-02-23T21:23:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2021-02-24-music-level-playing-field/","section":"post","summary":"Our paper argues taht fair competition in music streaming is restricted by the nature of the remuneration arrangements between creators and the streaming platforms, the role of playlists, and the strong negotiating power of the major labels.

The streaming platforms use a MCPS, or market-centred payout system, which is biased towards large market listeners. Contrary to UCPS, or user-centred payout systems, where all streams by all users are tallied up to determine the final distribution of subscription and advertisement revenues, MCPS uses weighted averaging that very heavily favours major music distributors and the biggest global stars.\nWe analyze these competition policy problems with Amelia Fletcher and Peter L. Ormosi in our forthcoming publication in a special issue of Competition Policy International, Music streaming: is it a level playing field?. But in the meantime, an interesting impact assessment emerged from France, because the Centre National de la Musique commissioned Deloitte to make an impact assessment on a possible change. Deezer provided a full overview of its 2019 payouts, while Spotify gave a sample of 100,000 artist payouts, and the other streaming services — for example, Apple Music — refused to cooperate with the French government-backed institution. You can read an English language summary and an excellent commentary from Emmanuel Legrand on his blog: User-centric model would not lead to significant changes in the distribution of music streaming royalties.\n  Which genres would be winners and losers in the fair payout?   Fair distribution would completely alter the revenues of different genres. The biggest winner would be classical music, but various forms of pop, rock, jazz and disco artists would earn 15–25% more revenue. Currently, rap and hip-hop take about an extra 20% royalty revenue at the expense of these genres.\nThe streaming providers, which are directly or indirectly part-owned by major labels, are playing down the results, claiming that the difference would translate only to a few euros per artists at the bottom of the pyramid. In a sense, this is true, because streaming royalties are generally very low. But averaging is extremely misleading, because it includes millions of songs that are out-of-date or for another reason are never heard. In fact, entire scenes and labels would earn about 10% more revenue globally, considering that streaming revenues add up to half or even more of their total recording revenue.\n","date":1613977800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613977800,"objectID":"fd99ca26bedcf03aa433eba6b226bc05","permalink":"/post/2021-02-21-cnm-streaming/","publishdate":"2021-02-22T09:10:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2021-02-21-cnm-streaming/","section":"post","summary":"Many people believe that if you play your favorite song again, the artist will receive more money.

It is critically important that an artist’s work is documented, described in a way that the algorithm can work with it.\nIn our research paper – soon to be published – made for the Listen Local Initiative we found that 15% of Dutch, Estonian, Hungarian, or Slovak artists had no chance to be recommended, and they usually end up on Forgetify, an app that lists never-played songs of Spotify. In another project with rights management organizations, we found that about half of the rightsholders are at risk of not getting all their royalties from the platforms because of poor documentation.\nBut how come that distributors give streaming platforms songs that are not properly documented? What sort of information is missing for the European repertoire’s visibility? Reprex is exploring this problem in a practical cooperation with SOZA, the Slovak Performing and Mechanical Rights Society, and in an academic cooperation that involves leading researchers in the field. A manuscript co-authored Martin Senftleben, director of the Institute for Information Law in Amsterdam, and eminent researchers in copyright law and music economics, Reprex’s co-founder makes the case that Europe must invest public money to resolve this problem, because in the current scenario, the documentation costs of a song exceed the expected income from streaming platforms.\n In the European Strategy for Data, the European Commission highlighted the EU’s ambition to acquire a leading role in the data economy. At the same time, the Commission conceded that the EU would have to increase its pools of quality data available for use and re-use. In the creative industries, this need for enhanced data quality and interoperability is particularly strong. Without data improvement, unprecedented opportunities for monetising the wide variety of EU creative and making this content available for new technologies, such as artificial intelligence training systems, will most probably be lost. The problem has a worldwide dimension. While the US have already taken steps to provide an integrated data space for music as of 1 January 2021, the EU is facing major obstacles not only in the field of music but also in other creative industry sectors. Weighing costs and benefits, there can be little doubt that new data improvement initiatives and sufficient investment in a better copyright data infrastructure should play a central role in EU copyright policy. A trade-off between data harmonisation and interoperability on the one hand, and transparency and accountability of content recommender systems on the other, could pave the way for successful new initiatives.

We started systematically collect publicly available information from Slovak artists (in our write-in process) and ask them to give GDPR-protected further data (in our opt-in process) to create a comprehensive database that can help recommendation engines as well as market-targeting or educational AI apps.\nWe believe that one of the problems of current AI algorithms that they solely or almost only work with English language documentation, putting other, particularly small language repertoires at risk of being buried below well-documented music mainly arriving from the United States.\nWe are looking for rightsholders and their organizations, artists, researchers to work with us to find out how we can increase the visibility of European music.\n","date":1613232600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613578200,"objectID":"5886c1d52fa056b6436c70138f3cd4eb","permalink":"/post/2021-02-13-european-visibility/","publishdate":"2021-02-13T18:10:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2021-02-13-european-visibility/","section":"post","summary":"While the US have already taken steps to provide an integrated data space for music as of 1 January 2021, the EU is facing major obstacles not only in the field of music but also in other creative industry sectors.

Our aim is\n Show how the Slovak repertoire is seen by media and streaming platforms What are the possibilities to give greater visibility to the Slovak repertoire in radio and streaming platforms What are the specific problems why certain artists and music is almost invisible.  In the next year, we would like to create a modern, comprehensive national music database that serves music promotion in radio, streaming, live music within Slovakia and abroad.\nTo train our locally relevant, alternative recommendation system, we filled the Demo Slovak Music Database from two sources. In the opt-in process we asked artists to participate in Listen Local, and we selected those artists who opted in from Slovakia, or whose language is Slovak. In the write-in process we collected publicly available data from other artists that our musicology team considered to be Slovak, mainly on the basis of their language use, residence, and other public biographical information. The following artists form the basis of our experiment. (If you want to be excluded from the write-in list, write to us, or you want to be included, please, fill out this form.)\n\r Click here to view the table on a separate page\nModern recommendation systems usually rely on data provided by artists or their representatives, data on who and how is listening to their music, and what music is listened to by the audience of the artists, and certain musicological features of the music. Usually they collect data from various data sources, but these data sources are mainly English language sources.\nThe problem with these recommendation systems is that they do not help music discovery, and make starting new acts very difficult. Recommendation systems tend to help already established artists, and artists whose work is well described in the English language.\nOur alternative recommendation system is a utility-based system that gives a user-defined priority to artists released in Slovakia, or artists identified as Slovak, or both. The system can be extended for lyrics language priorities, too. Currently, our app is demonstration to provide a more comprehensive database-driven tool that can support various music discovery, recommendation or music export tools. Our Feasibility Study to build such tools and our Demo App is currently under consultation with Slovak stakeholders.\n Listen Local is developing transparent algorithms and open source solutions to find new audiences for independent music.

Such a system may work well for an amateur DJ in a home party or a small local radio that just wants to make sure that the music in its programme will be liked by many people. They reinforce existing trends and make already popular songs and their creators even more popular.\nIf the recommendation engine is supported by big data and a machine learning system \u0026ndash; or increasingly, a combination of several machine learning algorithms \u0026ndash; the general modus operandi is to exploit information about both content and users in order to achieve certain goals.\nHow algorithmic recommendation systems work?   How recommendation systems work?   Spotify’s recommendation system is a mix of content- and collaborative filtering that exploits information about users’ past behaviour (e.g. liked, skipped, and re-listened songs), the behaviour of similar users, as well as data collected from the users' social media and other online activities, or from blogs. Deezer uses a similar system that is boosted by the acquisition of Last.fm \u0026ndash; big data created from user comments are used to understand the mood of the songs, for example.\n  Spotify makes 16 billion music recommendations each month in 2020.   YouTube, which plays an even larger role in music discovery, uses a system comprised of two neural networks: one for candidate generation and one for ranking. The candidate generation deep neural network provides works on the basis of collaborative filtering, while the ranking system is based on content-based filtering and a form of utility ranking that takes into consideration the user\u0026rsquo;s languages, for example.\nWhat makes these systems common is that they maximize the algorithm creators' corporate key performance indicators. Spotify wants to be ‘your playlist to life’ and increase the amount of music played during work or sports in the background, during travelling, or active music listening –- i.e. maximizing the number of hours spent using it, and do not let empty timeslots for other music providers, such as radio stations. YouTube and Netflix have similar targets. They are in many ways like commercial radio targets, which want to maximize the time spent listening to the broadcast stream. Radios and YouTube, in particular, have similar goals because they are mainly financed through advertising. For Spotify or Netflix, their key financial motivation is to avoid users' cancelling their subscriptions or changing it to different providers, such as Amzon, Apple or Deezer.\nWhat is the problem with black box recommendation systems? What they also have in common is that they do not aim to give a fair chance to each uploaded song, serve equally every artist, or provide whatever equality of chances for English, Slovak or Farsi language content.\nThey tend to reinforce trends similarly to music charts, but with far bigger efficiency. As the Dutch comedian, author and journalist Arjen Lubach explains the YouTube algorithm, to keep their personal recommendations engaging all the day and all of the night, they create a comfortable universe for the user allows little distraction in. If the user wants to listen to global hit music, or stoner rock, it will never be distracted with anything else.\n\rZondag met Lubach on Dutch public broadcaster VPRO. Click settings sign to change the language of the captions.\nThe problem with such hyper-personalized media is that they leave no room for public activities. Public broadcasters, which had a monopoly to television broadcasting in most European countries until the early 1990s, for example, were aiming to air a diversity of news, knowledge and access to local culture. Many countries on all continents have maintained local content guidelines for broadcasting on public, commercial and community television and radio channels, for example, local music and films, and reliable news as a public service. Personalized media-, social media- and streaming platforms do not have such obligations.\n  Black box recommendation systems usually maximize a corporate key performance indicator, and they are not subject to usual public new service or local content regulations that traditional broadcast media is.\n  The goal and the steps that the algorithm is pursuing is not know to content creators, and they do not know when will the algorithm work for their benefit or against them.\n  Transparent and regulated AI In our view, utility-based recommendation system can provide a bridge between current, corporate-owned systems that maximize a media or streaming platforms' business indicators.\nPublic new service requirements or local content requirements (\u0026ldquo;national quotas\u0026rdquo;) set for commercial broadcasting are similar to utility or knowledge-based recommendation systems. A utility-based recommendation system, for example, would prefer from two candidates for a playlist the one that has a Slovak composer, or a performer from Wales, or which has Farsi lyrics.\nOur Demo App creates recommendations on the basis of a pre-existing radio or personal streaming playlist that, by choice, contains a pre-defined ratio of music produced in Slovakia, or performed by Slovak artists. We will soon add Dutch and Hungarian choices to this demo, but naturally, we could add any city\u0026rsquo;s, regions', province\u0026rsquo;s our countries preferences into the app.\nOur Demo App and accompanying Feasibility Study in Slovakia shows how can a regulator create better broadcasting regulations, learning from the experience with AI-driven streaming platforms, and how can it apply the goals of local content requirements (such as a certain visibility for Slovak or a city-based music) and public service requirements (for example, spreading reliable information or stopping hateful music.)\nAccess for all We do not believe that the current heated discussion on the re-regulation of AI and music streaming will solve all the problems of independent artists, bands from ethnic or racial minorities, or otherwise vulnerable producers. New regulation can limit the unintended collateral damage of big data algorithms deployed by big corporations, but they will not bring down the benefits of AI to these creators.\nTake the example of the controversial new initiative that let\u0026rsquo;s artists, labels and publishers to promote their music in exchange for a cut in royalty rates. While felt by many artists injust and even corrupt, it is an answer to the growing need to influence how the recommendation algorithms are promoting certain music at the expense of tens of millions of sound recordings that are not recommended.\nWe believe that algorithms create value for the users, and if artists are not happy to pay for corporations to influence black box algoritms, thatn they must collaborate and share data, and build large enough data pools so that they can deploy white, transparent algorithms that work for them.\n  Our Feasibility Study shows why it is important that creators have a control over what data describes their music, their biographies and other information online, because corporate streaming platforms use this information for their algorithms.\n  We should that with relatively little effort creators can pool enough information to create alternative recommendation systems that follow a more agreeable goal, that is sensitive to local content requirements and more access to new artists, women or black performers, or which suppress hateful lyrics.\n  The benefit of an open algorithm and pooled data is that artists can actively look for audiences in various age groups or in cities that are accessible for them on a performing tour after the pandemic.\n  Overall, we want to show that regulating black box, private algorithms and data monopolies is only a first step to damage control. Deploying white, transparent algorithms and building collaborative or open data pools can only guarantee fairness in the digital platforms, in recommendations, and generally in the use of AI.\n Listen Local is developing transparent algorithms and open source solutions to find new audiences for independent music.

Nearby our space, one can stop at De Klub for a bite to eat, the local brewery De Kromme Haring for a beer, or the record store / coffee bar Koffie Leute around the corner. For those with more time during the day, I also recommend a few local record stores like Dig It or Plato or maybe a walk around Utrecht centre. For the full Utrecht experience, I recommend a dive into the postrock, slowcore, indiefolk vibes of this friendly city with bands if you can catch bands like The Fire Harvest, I am Oak, Homemade Empire, or This Leo Sunrise, among others. And of course there’s the Nijntje Museum, the Dom tower, and the canals.\n\rWhere do your artists hope to play next year? Where do they hope to find new fans?\nPersonally, I’d like to play in any city with a vibrant DIY scene. In the Netherlands, I’d like to rebook all the shows in Haarlem, Amsterdam, Eindhoven and in Liège (BE) that were cancelled due to COVID. I’d also like to add some shows in Groningen, Nijmegen, Enschede, Maastricht and Arnhem because I know they also have some small DIY scenes there, too.\n  Stefan Breuer / Tiny Rooms.   I\u0026rsquo;d like to play in any city with a vivid DIY scene. In the Netherlands, I\u0026rsquo;d like to re-book our shows that were all cancelled in Haarlem, Amsterdam, Eindhoven, and Liège. I\u0026rsquo;d like to add some shows in Groningen, Nijmegen, Enschede, Maastricht and Arnhem because I know they have small DIY scenes there too.\nHow do you and your artists see the role of YouTube, Spotify, Facebook, algorithms, big data?\nWe try to make sure all our bands are present on all of these platforms and actively engage with content as much as possible, but there’s not really enough time to get the most out of YouTube, for example, when you are also trying to write and record music, book shows, not to mention that artists involved with my label all have other work and families to be with. I’d say we all know the potential of the internet and big data, but the best we can do right now is just let as much happen with that as we can. We don’t really feel like we have any control over what happens in that area or our overall “success” on social media.\nHow much is your label really focused on Utrecht specifically? Where would you say the true home base of your label is, whether geographically or spiritually? Where do you have the strongest audience?\nSo Tiny Room Records is actually based in Utrecht and Bilthoven. Utrecht is a city. That’s where the scene happens and that’s what we’re part of. I live in Bilthoven, which is 5 kilometers away from Utrecht. It’s next to the woods. It’s quiet. It’s small. It’s perfect for focusing on creating beautiful music and art. There’s inspiration from the sight and smell of nature and not a lot of distractions like pubs and venues. So as a musician, my home base is Bilthoven. Running a label, it’s Utrecht because all the shows, recordings, and rehearsals happen there. It’s also where we’ve held most of the Tiny Room nights, and our 5th year anniversary festival.\nHow important is touring for your label’s roster? How do artists select touring locations? Where do you think your label’s strongest potential for finding a new audience would be?\nOur rehearsal space and venue Studio Patrick generates a DIY scene which is unique for Utrecht but not necessarily Europe. In the NL, we’ve always had a strong connection with Subblicious in Leiden, Lepel Concerts in Groningen, Roodkapje in Rotterdam, Vondelbunker in Amsterdam, Katzwijm Studio in Voorhout, De Ruimte in Amsterdam, the art scene around Danielle Papenborg in Nijmegen, and the Van Onderen festival. We’re also connected to labels like Subroutine, Moving Furniture, Snowstar, Coaster, Narrowminded, Geertruida and so on.\n\rWe use these contacts to set up tours and other possibilities long the way. Sometimes it doesn’t work out wen you have a Canadian artist playing for two people in Heerhugowaard, but you don’t know until you try. That’s how I stumbled upon the scene around Honest House, a label and booking agency in Liège, Belgium a couple years ago. It turned out to be perfect for all our bands and we still maintain a good partnership with them in order to regularly produce a few nights of live music. We will start working with them again around live music, of course, when we are post-COVID. Same goes for Lousy Moon Records in Köln. I think there are a lot more places like this and it would be great to have more insight about where the super DIY/indie/arty/folk/postpunk/kraut/experimental songwriting stuff is happening. I know it’s there in a lot of cities in its own form, but the audience is so small that it’s hard to get to know all the cool places. I’d like to focus on NL, Belgium, Germany, and France since these areas are the most doable for a weekend or week long tour.\nWhat’s more important? Belonging to a scene, a genre, a subculture, or a location? How are these connected?\nFor me, it’s important to belong to a scene. These are the people here in Utrecht that care about what we do, our shows, and our releases. They come to support the bands, have a great time, and we all know each other, have the same values, and we’re good friends, too. Maybe some call that a “subculture” too, but no one I know calls it by a particular name.\nYou need a location to get together, but you can build a scene anywhere, I guess. My dad even built a vibrant music scene in the middle of nowhere in France in a village of 200 people. About genre, I don’t want to focus on one thing. For the label, I have a specific thing in mind — music that I really love — which is based on my own taste. Most people at the shows we host are most interested in music that’s more experimental, unique, even a bit raw and unusual. I can be ambient, indie rock, punk, sloppy folk, doom songwriters, slowcore, noise, etc. If it’s too catchy or a “normal” radio friendly singer/songwriter, the audience scratches their heads and I won’t have a good time either.\nWhat kind of insight and intelligence would you like from Listen Local, which tries to crunch a lot of data about location, language, and the genre of small acts?\nI would like to know where similar scenes are in other cities, where they host shows, and who books them, mainly in the Netherlands and surrounding countries, but also possibly in Italy, Switzerland. The bonus is that this also gives me some cool new bands to listen to as well. They would probably have a good audience here in Utrecht and we could probably do a “gig swap.”\nIdeally it would make booking easier so that you won’t have to reinvent the wheel each time and hunt for new places, although that can also lead to some great adventures and memories, so I would not rule that out entirely. About genres, I hope to find bands that look beyond genre and experiment with sound, culture, and performance.\n","date":1607926200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607926200,"objectID":"61b393b8ab697c96d1db553fc75e52a3","permalink":"/post/2020-12-14-tinyrooms/","publishdate":"2020-12-14T08:10:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2020-12-14-tinyrooms/","section":"post","summary":"I’d say we all know the potential of the internet and big data, but the best we can do right now is just let as much happen with that as we can.

Changing genres and forms, creating musical and visual worlds spiced up with BDSM attire they have been playing shows in Slovakia and releasing a full-length album in 2018. Tammy is a bilingual Slovak, who is more comfortable in the English language due to her upbringing than in the country’s language, and against what she feels to be the expectation of the local audience, she sings in English. No wonder that she is also looking for ways to expand their universe beyond the country borders.\n\rTammy believes that The Youniverse it at a crossroads. To be more successful at home, they would have to switch to their native Slovak language, and to be more successful in English they would have to connect better to foreign audiences. She believes that the local audiences often seek a different quality than what she offers – the purity of her voice instead of auto-tune, or the native language instead of the language of rock and roll. Therefore, their main targets are the Southwestern part of the United States, particularly Los Angeles in California and Austin in Texas, and they believe that their eccentric show would probably create interest in Japan, too.\nWhat do they know or think of big data algorithms? The Youniverse hired a Google Analytics manager and they try to figure out how they could reach out to fans in far away places, or to understand how their songs occasionally find their ways to people in different countries. Tammy knows that Spotify employs playlist curators who are helped with computer-based algorithms to find new music, but she is not familiar with the process – that is why she volunteered to participate in our Listen Local project and our Feasibility Study for the creation of a Slovakian music promotion service.\n\r Listen Local is developing transparent algorithms and open source solutions to find new audiences for independent music.

These captchas are there to prevent robots filling out the forms with funny data, steal your email address or to pretend to be human viewers for paid traffic, because who wants to pay for bots visiting the website?\nThe problem with the captcha business is that until now, Google was the main provider of them, which created an inherent conflict of interests. Google, as the world\u0026rsquo;s biggest advertising agency, has an interest in letting robots viewing advertisements - something that the \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; captchas are supposed to stop. And Google let\u0026rsquo;s them do it in a small percent of the cases. Those small percent add up to billions of page views.\nRobots learned to fill in captchas, but Google did not fundamentally change the way they work, instead it released its 3rd version, which collects plenty of personal data about the viewer \u0026ndash; an important input again for its advertisment personalization business.\nAnd third, but not least, solving captchas became an industry itself. Human understanding of pictures trains all sorts of AI applications from self-driving cars to medical diagnostics.

Photography by Ladislav Kyllar   Katarzia, or Katarína Kubošiová, is a Slovak singer, lyricist and producer. In 2020 she released her fourth album Celibát with the main themes of loneliness and self-appreciation. Album was created in collaboration with the producer Jonatán Pastirčák.\nKatarzia started her career as a folk singer. In the past years she moved on towards electronic music. She describes her current sound can as a mix of folk and electropop. The tour to promote her newest album Celibát had been planned for spring 2020, unfortunately due to the Covid-19 pandemic had to be postponed indefinitely. As many other artists, Katarzia thinks that the current situation is not easy.\nAt the moment, I am not working on any new projects. I am looking for a new job. Once the pandemic is over, I would like to stay where I am now, and return to the clubs to play for my audience. As I sing in Slovak, I know where my place is – I don\u0026rsquo;t want to perform abroad, of course, unless I turn to techno music. On a more personal level, I would like to live in New York – not as a musician, tough.\nKatarzia is originally from Nitra, Slovakia and she has been living in Prague for a couple of years.\nI live in Dejvice – there is a nice clubroom there, but I don\u0026rsquo;t visit that much. I enjoy going to National Theatre, Dejvice Theatre, Meetfactory, Archa Theatre and Rudolfinum. All the old classics.\nDespite the restrictions during the pandemic, Katarzia managed to shoot a video for her song Hoří i voda from Celibát.\n\rThe music video is a short film, directed by Jay Walker, an American who lives and works in Prague.

People usually discover new music in their young age as they are forming their own personal identity with their peer group. This process mainly happens in the school, where similarly aged, educated young people spend much of their day together.\nThe music discovery phase is strongly related to the time when most people get their music education: their skills to listen to music, play music or sing, and to compose new music. Investment into music education pays of in later age: people with more diverse music education, for example, with the ability to play music, tend to visit concerts more or discover more music in later life stages.\n  The annual growth (top chart) and total growth (lower chart) of the 15-24 years-old population in select European countries.   For practical reasons and supported by academic research, we chose the age group 15-24 as the key age group for music discovery. We placed the national population of the music discovery age group in the Music \u0026amp; Society pillar of the Demo Music Observatory.\nThe changes across Europe are dramatic: in Latvia and the Baltic states, the music discovery age population decreased by 60% since the countries (re-)gained independence in 1991. Musicians and their organizations must work hard in these countries on developing export strategies if they want to maintain the market and audience of their music.\nSome European countries, for example, the Netherlands and Turkey have significantly increased their future audiences. In Turkey this is mainly related to population growth, in the Netherlands to immigration. Countries with a growing young population have a strong position for their music business.\nNot all lost in the Baltics and other countries where the music discovery age population  is shrinking. Much of the lost young population migrated to the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe. If artists and their association in these countries find a way to connect with these new diaspora, their market loss will be far less dramatic. Connecting to the diaspora is the most natural way to start exporting new music.\n Get the data from the Demo Music Observatory.

Having crisis in their workplace, try to find their identity, falling in love or getting heartbroken and anyway, just trying to be happy in this chaotic world. The twentees writes their indie-pop songs about the typical issues and problems of the Y-generation, so it is easy to understand when you are in the same shoes, what are they singing about.\nBack in 2015 the band released their first album in English, partly as a respect to their idols like Editors, Bloc Party or Vaccines, but also, because they were a bit afraid to write their lyrics in their native Hungarian. For their second album Múlandó Transient they found their sound in their mother tongue, and kept releasing in Hungarian since 2018. Their next EP is just arriving\u0026hellip; soon.

Craft beer bars are highly recommended, but the city has pretty great pubs in general. Walking alongside the river on the Buda side offers a great panorama to the city, which includes the best looking parliament building of Europe. For daytime activities, getting on a bike and going to less busy parts, like the Danube banks Római-part and Kopaszi-gát are nice, or maybe do some downtown record store shopping. For the night time, cruising around the 6th, 7th, and 8th districts will result in good fun.\n\rWhere are you heading to? To Romania, particularly in the direction of Oradea, Cluj Napoca, Timișoara, because there are lots of people interested in checking out their Hungarian friends from the other side of the border and because their mountains are lovely. Bratislava and any towns with a relevant Hungarian-speaking population in Slovakia, for the same reason mentioned before, and because their mountains are also nice. There’s Serbia, too, with towns like Senta, Subotica and Novi Sad, where I was born: the local audience is the most grateful one I’ve ever seen, they are really curious for new music.\nAs we sing in Hungarian, we try to target regions where our songs can be understood, and of course it would make no sense to go and play in Berlin with our lyrics.\n Listen Local is developing transparent algorithms and open source solutions to find new audiences for independent music.

We created a testing database with their music and other artists from their cities, regions and countries. We need new recommendation engines to dig out from a pile of international hits the local artists.\n Avoid landing on Forgetify, in the universe of never listened-to-songs. Understand how artists and their songs can find audience in the region relevant to their career goals, tour destinations, export opportunities.  Our preliminary analysis is not representative for nationality, though we believe that we will find serious regional, linguistic and national patterns. We are using examples from Spotify. To be fair to Spotify, while their algorithm has many problems, their API is at least very open, as opposed to Apple Music where we do not really know what is going on.\nOur main concern is that some artists and their songs seem to be never recommended. Moreover, if artists and songs from a city, region or country are rarely or never recommended, then they risk losing their home market: the local audience will be recommended music that is coming outside of the city, region or country.\n  Artist has more related artists as number popularity and number of followers grows. Nationality may affect related artists.   One of the most important way recommendations work is via related artists. If an artist has no related artists, it is very unlikely that either via user browsing interaction or via the algorithm that artists or her songs will be discovered by anybody.\nIf you want your music and audience to be analysed in Listen Local, fill out this form.

Artists with very little popularity tend to be related to 20-30 artists, but at a popularity level of 40-60 they are related to 30-40 artists. Seems simple, right?\nNot that much. If you want the algorithm to learn your music well, you really have to go \u0026ldquo;viral\u0026rdquo;.\n  Artist with less than 1000 followers risk not being to recommended at all. Doubling your chances to be discovered requires 1000x more followers.   Doubling your routes to being recommended via other artists' music requires exponential growth. You need to have 1000x more followers to double the routes leading to your artist profile and recordings.\nAs we have shown, the current recommendation engines are re-enforcing the existing status quo, and they can re-enforce the marginal status of subcultures, artists from a nation, city or region. In other words, as we often say, big data creates injustice.\nWith our Music Observatory for larger organizations and with our Listen Local analytics and recommendations for artists, managers and labels, we want to fight exactly this injustice.

We do not try to find yet another similar song to user, but we would like to find audience to a song. We want to avoid that new artists are ending up on the Forgetify list, or among hundreds of thousands of artists that the streaming platform algorithms recommend to no-one.\nIf you are an independent artist, band, label, or publisher, we encourage you to add your very short bio into our database (form here, if you want to add several bands/artists, get in touch with us and we\u0026rsquo;ll provide you a spreadsheet), and try out our demo application. Our system will be transparent: we try to make big data algorithms work for you, not against you.

However, there are very few labels and artists who actually feel that they are profiting from this conversion.\nIn our Central European Music Industry Report we have shown the paradox of streaming growth: while the streaming market appears to be growing, for the individual rightsholder, artists, or label, neither the volumes nor the revenues show much of a growth. There are many factors contributing to the fact that for the ‘typical’ artist streaming does not bring revenue growth, and one of them is the increasing competition with the major label released music, particularly from the United States.\n  For a long time, the user base of Spotify and similar services did not expand at the same rate as the available repertoire, so more and more songs were competing for not so many users, many of them ending up on the never played Forgetify list. In other words, competition has been steadily growing.\n  In Europe, almost everybody would like to get to the U.S. (getting harder and harder) or the UK (getting somewhat more accessible). Some have a strong market background at home, others lost their home market without gaining foreign markets.\n  Some smaller markets are somewhat protected from the competition often have low revenues because of the lower subscription fee and slower roll-out of the services. In the first years of the introduction of these services, like in Croatia or Russia this year, it is critically important to use this period to gain experience with holding or increasing local market shares.\n  The local music industry must find ways to train algorithms, promote local music contain that is relevant for the new audiences who use streaming platforms. Our Listen Local Initiative aims build new data integrations that can help training data that reverses this trend.\n  Our Music Observatory project is aiming to track all indicators that jointly determine streaming success: subscription fees, exchange rates, subscription numbers, use hours, levels of competition, typical playing volumes, typical stream prices, and likelihood of crossing borders to export markets.\n  Our aim with the Demo Music Observatory is to find a validated business model to bring to light the roughly 2000 indicators collected by our CEEMID project for music pricing, AI, licensing, monitoring, grant evaluation, export market targeting and similar uses. We would like to transfer these data assets to a future European Music Observatory. We are giving away in these weeks about 50 automatically maintained, well documented, high-quality indicators with history and timely new data publications for potential users and founding partners of the European Music Observatory.\nWe placed the following dataset in our observatory, to be refreshed weekly:\nYou can download the entire dataset in different formats here in the Music Diversity \u0026amp; Circulation pillar (see all pillars) of our Demo Music Observatory.\nWe share the view that big data creates injustice. Organizations that control large amounts of data, for example, the entire listening history of hundreds of millions of people in all major countries of the world, can train algorithms and robots that drive most of the music sales in the world. They can make your investment into a sound recording successful or doomed. They can circumvent or help a local content regulation, reinforce, or disable a national cultural policy goal. We want big data to work for small venues, independent labels, startups, great and undiscovered artists. We believe that you cannot make a successful album launch, a market entry or introduce a successful cultural policy without large amounts of well processed and correctly analysed data. We want to create a Music Observatory that integrates the small data of many small bands, small labels, small venues, small countries, and mount correct the injustice.

Anti-Semitism and glorification of the Holocaust was commonn in their lyrics.\nHow can an algorithm become racist?\n  If it is trained on the tastes and habits of “white people”, it will less likely recommend “black music.”\n  If a music is coming from a “black” community, it will probably not recommend it in the “white community.”\n  If the algorithm learns that taste of racists people, it will provide them with more racist material.\n  Of course, you can replace black and white with any minority and majority group. Take Slovak and American; major release and independent release. European independent music makers may feel a minority compared to international majors. The problem with algorithms is that they can ruthlessly reinforce injustice, because they just learn how to do something better, faster, and more than before.\nWhat can we do?\n Fight for the removal of inappropriate content from the training set. If you see any non-English hateful songs on these platforms, let us know, because English-language moderation is just the tip of the iceberg.

Originally from Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, he finished last year putting their former band’s songs into a 40-minute feature film Delta wave (2019) with English subtitles and started to look for a new music film challenge. Propeler, with one Bosnian ‘l’, had to move on with a new drummer, and Duka wanted to find himself a new music project in his new town, Cologne, Germany.\nHe is now making a series of songs, where he is the author of all music and lyrics, but he is inviting recording artists from all over the word to make recorded audio and video performances. He gives much freedom to the performing artists to interpret his songs the way they like, and he dreams that one day, when the pandemia is gone, he will be able to perform the entire set live. These songs are released on all platforms that Distroid covers under the name Duka Base (see for example Spotify here)\n   Duka Base - Watch Me (feat. Amina Kamran)\nDuka was initially struggling with the same problem as we do in Data \u0026amp; Lyrics when we try to explain our Listen Local or Music Observatory projects. “It was hard at the beginning to convince artists to take a part in the show, because it was hard to describe the whole idea. After the first show, everything went better, because the artist could see exactly what I wanted from them. Now, the response is way better of course.”\nAnd then it started to go smoothly. “All those artists have had their own home studios, and it went quick and well. But it\u0026rsquo;s a bit harder to record the video, because all the artists with whom I worked are musicians, and not filmmakers. All in all, I am very happy with the willingness of the artists to do it as best they can, and at the end, I am happy with the outcome. It\u0026rsquo;s interesting for me how I talked with everyone the same way I would talk with someone in Cologne.

That led to an uneasy series of conversations with the consultants of this project, and a very enlightening series of conversations with European civil servants, music industry organizations, music managers and artists. My main pitch was that every single assumption of this project is wrong.\nThey started from the assumption that there is hardly any data available on the European music scene \u0026ndash; whereas we found while building up CEEMID, errr, a pan-European music data observatory, is that music is one of the most data-driven industries in the world, it is choking in numbers, and the reason why this data is not visible is very different. They were talking about lack of data in fields where we already had about 2000 pan-European indicators ready. (See Introducing the CEEMID Observatory, 9/28/2019 large self-contained html file, takes time to load into browser)\nBig data creates injustice The music industry is scattered: it has the author’s or publishing side, the recording side, a large live music business and usually a very environment for classical (art) music. Within these segments there are hundreds of organizations in each EU country, and each have their own small or large datasets. The music industry has plenty of data, but it is not integrated, and it is often hidden from organizations that may have a conflicting agenda.\nThe fragmentation of data makes these players easy prey in the era of big data. Companies who monopolise big datasets first and create weapons of math destruction in the forms of algorithms that work for them, can take an unusually large share of the money created throughout the value chain. Proprietary, uncontrolled, big data trained algorithms reinforce inequality \u0026mdash; this makes Google’s YouTube, Spotify, but also Netflix in films or Amazon in books so powerful against its competitors, but also against competition regulators or suppliers \u0026mdash; in this case songwriters, video producers, filmmakers, book publishers and authors. If their algorithm works against a creator, the creator is doomed, because half of the global sales are driven by secret algorithms.\nBig Data vs Small Datasets, Research Automation The problem of the music industry is not too little, but too much data. Music is drowning in numbers, and it has too little resources to turn much data into valuable information.\nOur concept of the European Music Observatory is to pool enough resources to create value for rightsholders, talent managers, venues, festivals and the entire music ecosystem. Most music organization employ 1-5 people, and even the largest national organization, like collective management organizations, fall under the EU definition of small- and medium sized enterprises. They do not have data scientists, market researchers, forecasters. They are small organizations with small research budgets and very little time for researching. Nevertheless, with more than 60 partners in 12 countries we have shown that this is possible:\n  we turned 700 million royalty statements into meaningful indicators about the price and volume growth in 20 European streaming markets;\n  calculated the value gap and the value of private copying in Hungary and Croatia;\n  helped closing the royalty gap in Hungary and Slovakia by helping collective management to significantly increase their royalty collection;\n    helped granting agencies to make more relevant grant calls and designed indicators to measure the impact of their grants;\n  started the creation of local recommendation engines that help the circulation of the small nation repertoires or city scenes in Europe or beyond.\n  Music Has Data, But You Need A Map Scattered industries tend to be riddled with conflicts of interests. While working with royalty collection management societies in the last 7 years I often saw that songwriters, producers and performers are often fighting each other for slices of the pie that is just too small. That means that national members of CISAC (GESAC in Europe), IFPI, and AEPO-ARTIS often do not share data with each other, although their income is below any legally acceptable threshold. They have individually very rich datasets that in many jurisdictions just never meet. Labels, small publishers are so little organizations that they do not have a data scientist, let alone a dedicated IT person, or even an HR professional to hire the services of data scientists.\nWe were able to collect at least 70% of the information content of the planned European Music Observatory, and far more, than most of the 50 data observatories we examined in Europe, because we took an approach inspired in open source software development: continuous opt-in, opt-out data integration, focusing on the synergies that partners can achieve, instead of aiming at endless discussions and compromises on sharing data. We never take away proprietary data from anybody, we just connect data among partners, and enrich it with open data. We would like to guide the industry from hierarchical database planning to the philosophy of open collaboration.\n  We automated most of the research tasks, to make it less costly, less error-prone, and require less labour input. We can automate most of the data collection, data processing, imputation, validation, documentation, reporting, even some modelling.\n  We invested into harvesting the vast open data of the European Union and its member states. In the EU, most taxpayer funded research data is freely available, but at a cost of significant data reprocessing cost. If the data was originally collected to calculate to inflation or monitor tax revenues, it needs to be significantly altered for the music industry to be useful.\n  We have found a way to connect many small data sources and open data. We can create big data from much small data, and deploy analytics, algorithms on collective datasets.\n  ","date":1603785600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603785600,"objectID":"3ce30c56d2e1030df47234193a415540","permalink":"/post/2020-10-27-why-start-music-observatory/","publishdate":"2020-10-27T10:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2020-10-27-why-start-music-observatory/","section":"post","summary":"The problem of the music industry is not too little, but too much data.

For me, Forgetify has always been a puzzling and wonderful application, because it shows purely where your artists do not want to end up.\n Forgetify is a wonderful application that is “recommending” you songs that have never been played on Spotify. Music from artists that has not been played by their fans, their friends or foes, brothers and sisters, children and grandchildren! I use recommendations in quotation marks, because their recommendations are usually based on your taste. Forgetify just picks you a song that has not been played on Spotify ever. (Never been played means that somebody may have started it, but very soon stopped playing the song.)\nWhat connects me to Forgetify particularly is their motto: “We love music.”\nAs you can learn from their website, there are millions of Spotify songs that have been played only partially or never at all. And that is exactly the opposite that our partners want to achieve when they work with us.\nI started to create several playlists with Forgetify. All I did is that I took their “recommendation” and put it on a list, then hit next. I skipped tracks that were not licensed to the Netherlands, or which were not music tracks but spoken words, for example sound recordings of stand-up comedies. Then I put these tracks on three lists\n something that I felt was appropriate called classical music another that is popular music and another which is a mix of historical recordings, and other music which I think has such a special audience that it would not make a good mix with the other two.  For example, the Eightsome Reel Pt 1 by the Bob Smith\u0026rsquo;s Ideal Band is a digitalized re-release of the LP re-release of 78'' records from the 1930s, and it is obviosuly no competitor for a modern classical or pop music track. Even the labels popular music or classical music would call for further explanation, but we\u0026rsquo;ll get there another time.\nSo, let\u0026rsquo;s see what we have after removing historical, traditional folk, spoken word and classical music tracks in the supposedly popular music \u0026ldquo;recommendations\u0026rdquo;:\n\rSimilarly to the use of the the word “recommendations”, the expression of “popular music” is a bit ironic here, because we are talking about music that is anything but popular, at least not on Spotify.\nFirst let\u0026rsquo;s make a very short comparison of the current global hits, a subjective list that I created for this month and started to use for explaining our recommendations, my Forgetify Pop October 2020 list. I will follow these songs in the coming years, and will keep adding new forgotten songs to my list. Then I\u0026rsquo;ll reflect on why these songs are forgotten.\nA Quick Comparison The next comparison uses some musicology and sound engineering “features” of the songs on the three lists. These characteristics are themselves recognized by algorithms, and they are used for Spotify’s own recommendations.\nIf anything is clear from these boxplots is that there is nothing clear about forgotten songs. The boxplot\u0026rsquo;s box show the typical values of popularity or other features, and the line starting from the box still relatively frequent values. The long boxes of the Forgetify Pop list show that there are all sorts of music on Forgetify: screechy and not, danceable and not, cheerful and sad. My subjective list is shorter and more pronounced: it contains songs that I found to be a good match to listen together. The current global hits are less similar than my personal selection, but far more homogeneous than all those millions of songs that end up in the forgotten long tail of the catalogue.\nOf course, the only thing that connects this playlist is that the songs are not classical or world/folk music, and that they are forgotten. The This Time single from 2009 by the Intonated (3 listeners this month, including myself) is heavy guitar music. It is dark. Perdido from the Candido Featuring Al Cohn album released in 1956 by the Cándido Camero (6945 monthly listeners) is a cheerful jazz song. It is likely that this song actually has an audience, but not on Spotify. Cándido was born as Candido de Guerra Camero in 1921 in Havana, and with his 99 years he is one of the oldest living artists on Spotify. He recorded this album almost 40 years before the internet was opened for the public. For his life long achievement in Afro-Cuban jazz he received the National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters Award in 2008.\nMy personal favorite from the Forgetify Pop list is Groovy \u0026amp; Linda from the Neon Princess album released in 1968 by Tom Parrott (39 monthly listeners). It is a nice hippy song with the favorite effect of \u0026lsquo;68, the inclusion of a sitar. The song is not very good, the sitar and the guitar make a rather chaotic mix, but Tom Parrott (born in 1944, Washington DC, United States) is not forgotten because he was bad. There are many songs on Forgetify that I would like to skip in seconds, but Parott\u0026rsquo;s music can stay with me.\nWhy Are Songs Forgotten? One seemingly trivial reason is the age of the music. The current global hits are very new releases. The songs I curated for this months were released 2-25 years ago, though some of them are featured with newer re-releases on Spotify. Many songs on Forgetify are much older.\nOur research and other\u0026rsquo;s research show that people typically listen less and less music as they age. There are many people who listen to music lifelong, but others do it less and less, or completely drop the habit. And a large majority of the people tend to listen to similar music that she liked in her teenage years. For most young women and men, the music discovery period ends with school, typically in some post-secondary education institution. Later, they are no longer together with ther cohort peer-grew, but with people from all age and demographic groups when they work. Very few songs become perennial hits, and most of them lose their audience as the fans are getting older, and drop the habit of listening to music.\nHow can you make sure that your music will have a healthy audience for many years to come? Make sure that teenagers in your country get access to local music, for example, via the school radios, and by bringing them to local shows. That people have a chance to discover it. Build a large enough audience while your band is active who will stay loyal to you.\nAnother important factor is the country where the music was released. Most of the current global hits come from the United States, and some from the United Kingdom, South Korea, Germany and Russia. My personal selection included the dEUS from Antwerpen, Belgium, David Kitt from Dublin, Ireland, and The Harmaleighs Nashville, TN, are Americans who were released by Nettwerk Music Group in Vancouver, Canada.\nThe forgotten tracks come from all over the world. Many of them are Americans, because the US has the biggest recording industry and recorded far the most songs in the last 100-120 years. But on Forgetify my first 50 finds contained songs from Brazil, Finland, France, India, Palestine and Spain, not to mention plenty of classical recordings made all over the world.\nSpotify has a global audience, but it\u0026rsquo;s main audiences are in the US, Japan, South Korea, Germany and the United Kingdom. It\u0026rsquo;s algorithms are trained to serve these audiences, and its new content is coming from these countries. And it recommends very goods songs from these places.\nBecause concert and festival promoters, and even radio editors are often basing their decisions on YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music followers, streams and likes, the global platforms may make it extremely difficult for niche genres (for example, ancient or classical music), or small nation artists (such as Slovaks, Belgians) or older artists to get heard.\nI personally do not believe that it is entirely the platform\u0026rsquo;s fault. Our Listen Local initiative is aiming to use these platforms better, and find global audiences for great music made in small nations and small towns, or niche genres.\n","date":1603555200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603555200,"objectID":"a884c8f5c3974d14a076724ba722cfe5","permalink":"/post/2020-10-24-forgetify_pop_october/","publishdate":"2020-10-24T18:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2020-10-24-forgetify_pop_october/","section":"post","summary":"Forgetify is an application that is “recommending” you songs that have never been played on Spotify - not even by their families, friends or foes.

If you are all small, even local content guidelines, such as national radio quotas or public radio targets will not help you, because you remain invisible.\nWith the support of the Slovak Arts Council, SOZA, non-profit civic association representing more than 2,600 rights holders in Slovakia and over 1 million abroad (musical works composers, lyrics and publishers), and Consolidated Independent, a music distributor platform Reprex is preparing a feasibility study for the collaborative, transparent research tool and application that helps you to find your way to radio playlists, connect to fans in your own city, country, and in other towns along viable tour routes. Make music export more of a science than a guessing game.\nIn the first step, until the end of 2020, we are going to create a demo application and a feasibility study with quantitative musicologists and data scientists. The demo application will show how to use AI to place the music of the volunteering bands and labels’s repertoire on radio lists and personal playlists. Our feasibility study will show how different local content guidelines (radio quotas, public broadcaster targets, and other tools) can affect the market share of small local and national repertoires, and will provide culture policymakers and competition authorities with insight how to make the algorithm-driven music streaming, broadcasting marketplace more even.\nHow can you participate in the experiment?   In the first phase of the experiment, only artists and their groups released on Spotify can participate.\n  Participation in the experiment is free. The research findings, including potential targets for your music, will be fully open, transparent and free.\n  If you are an artist, you can simply fill in a form identifying your music on Spotify, filling in a few biographical data about yourself (or your band, ensemble, group). We do not ask any financial data, and only very limited personal information. We only ask about city affiliations, targeted cities, age, experience level, and language of your lyrics, if you do not play instrumental music. In our experience, these factors are very important among musicology and sound engineering quality measures. (Read a bit more about our data data use)\n  If you are a fan of independent music, please, forward this post to a band that you would love to see in our project, or a local music venue that you would like to visit again after the covid-19 pandemic.\n    Our project originally started out of Slovakia, Hungary, Czechia and Poland, but we only found funding in Slovakia for a low-budget, open source, open data, open collaboration experiment. Participation is open anywhere in the world, but we are focusing on a viable post-covid tour route around Budapest – Bratislava – Vienna – Salzburg – Munich – Ruhr – the Netherlands – Belgium. We hope to give guidance on targeting both recorded and live music.\n  If you represent several artists as a talent manager, music publisher, record label, granting agency or music export office, please get in touch with us for onboarding. We will ask you to contribute a small sum on a crowdsourcing basis to expand our experimental project, but the small financial contribution is not a mandatory requirement.

This month reflects our team’s journey into one of the world’s most prestigious startup validation lab in the AI field, in a year when the recession is deeper than ever since the World War 2, the music business is devastated by the pandemic, and our team is forced to lockdown, follow this excellent validation lab on Zoom screens, meet our first clients online, and learn to work together in a socially distanced way. The songs I chose are subjectively important to me, a bit maybe even controversial ones, and probably very different from the music that you are listening to.\nI would like to use this example as a start of series how we are thinking about connecting musicians and their fans in new ways with the help of AI and big data. How we are planning to bring back life to the small venues after the pandemic? How we try to keep the link between musicians and their audience alive in this very sad year?\nIn this chart you can see a short analysis of my Wounded Egos playlist. It is a very personal, subjective playlist. Subjectivity is very important to us, because we want to use the insights from big data and machine learning in a very personal way to the music community: fans, artists, technicians, managers, labels, publisher and all the ecosystem. You can play my playlist in Spotify’s embedded player.\nBelow the music player you find a very short comparison of the current global hits and the current hits in the Netherlands on Spotify. This time I would like to illustrate the difference of my listening habits from the global mainstream, and I won\u0026rsquo;t go in depth to how we want to make more relevant recommendations. These are the difference that we are trying to capture for local music scenes, cities, countries in our Listen Local initiative.\nIf you find it interesting why I chose these songs in October 2020, you read about my choices as a personal recommendation at the end of the post.\n\rA Quick Comparison My playlist is a very subjective and curated playlist\u0026hellip; (I curated it myself, after all!) These songs are very different from the songs that people are more likely listening to around me in the Netherlands, or all over the world.\n  My subjective list for October 2020: 1. Wounded Egos - 2. Sirens - 3. Don\u0026rsquo;t Panic - 4. Can\u0026rsquo;t Stop - 5. Michael And Heather At The Baggage Claim - 6. Machinist - 7. Royal Screw Up - 8. Kyoto - 9. It\u0026rsquo;s Yours\n  The Netherlands Top 50 on Spotify (3rd week of October 2020): 1. Mood (feat. iann dior) - 2. Lemonade (feat. Gunna, Don Toliver \u0026amp; NAV) - 3. Head \u0026amp; Heart (feat. MNEK) - 4. In De Schuur - 5. Jerusalema (feat. Nomcebo Zikode) - 6. Holy (feat. Chance The Rapper) - 7. Más Más Más - 8. De Overkant - 9. Door De Wind\n  Global Top 50 on Spotify (3rd week of October 2020): 1. Mood (feat. iann dior) - 2. Lemonade (feat. Gunna, Don Toliver \u0026amp; NAV) - 3. WAP (feat. Megan Thee Stallion) - 4. Hawái - 5. Dynamite - 6. What You Know Bout Love - 7. For The Night (feat. Lil Baby \u0026amp; DaBaby) - 8. Blinding Lights - 9. Holy (feat. Chance The Rapper)\n  The most streamed songs in the Netherlands overlap with the most streamed songs all over the world, but there is no overlap with my list.\nOur aim is to create locally relevant recommendations. If you live in Antwerpen, and you are looking for bands that you can see on a small stage after the pandemic, we will recommend you great music from Northwestern Belgium and the South of Holland. If you want to visit San Diego after the pandemic, we’ll recommend you music from the San Diego scene. If you want to fill up with good music a local content quota, such as a national and city relevant quota in your radio, we will help you.\nThe next comparison uses some musicology and sound engineering “features” of the songs on the three lists. These characteristics are themselves recognized by algorithms, and they are used for Spotify’s own recommendations.\nMy songs are independent songs, far less popular than the global hits. My playlist is mainly indie rock, so far less danceable, less loud than the current hits, but it is more energetic! The average tempo is similar to the hits, but I tend to chose slower songs, too.\nSpotify’s valence is a quantitative measure that aims to capture the positiveness conveyed by the a sound recording(e.g.happy, cheerful, euphoric on the positive side, and sad, depressed, angry on the negative side). Another striking difference among my list and the two hitlists is the far broader scale of emotions conveyed by the songs that I selected for October 2020.\nIn the next blogposts we will explain some details.\nWounded Egos: Daniel’s October Playlist 1. Gaz Coombes - Wounded Egos\nStarting up a company, building a team in the times of corona, social distancing, zoom calls and narcissistic world leaders is hard.\n2. dEUS - Sirens “You gotta pick your fights, you’ve got work to do”\nWhich makes you think that you have to resist the Sirens call. This record came out the day before I went to my CFA exam, which was the most gruelling test in my life. I just downloaded it, put it on the car hifi, pressed play and did the 8 hour test without error.\nThe Harmaleighs - Don’t Panic\n“But what if that’s all I’m good at?”\nDon’t Panic surprised me so much that it found its way to my September and October playlist, too. If something is perfect, it is perfect.\nJon Spencer Blues Explosion - Can’t Stop\n“I just can’t stop”\nSometimes I need to go back to the basics. Jon Spencer is as good as Elvis must have been on stage. I never saw Elvis on stage, I am too young for that, but old enough to have seen Jon Spencer on a large and small stage.\nFountains of Wayne - Michael And Heather At The Baggage Claim\n“Michael \u0026amp; Heather at the baggage claim tired of playing the waiting game”\nThe covid pandemic not only froze the entire music industry, and put many artists, venues, managers, technicians on life support, but claimed many lives in the audience and in the music community. I still come to tears when I recall that early March day when I learned that Adam Schlesinger, my favourite lyricist and songwriter died. I was alwayshoping that I will show him what we were doing. We will certainly dedicate something to his memory along the way. For 15 years, when I was sad, I just picked one of the Fountains of Wayne records, and put it on. For this playlist, I chose a bittersweet song, which probably has the best poetry written in independent music ever.\nSpotify falls for the typical Schlesinger trick: the melody is very upbeat, the lyrics is bittersweet. Spotify risks to put it into the positive and danceable category, at least, within my list, though I find it just a bit less gloomy than Don’t Panic and the Royal Screw Up.\nJapanese Breakfast - Machinist\n“How can I fight a kingdom of your demons?”\nI can’t complain about the big algorithms of the big company. Spotify’s algorithm brought Japanese Breakfast to me. We just want to take a less individualist approach to making recommendations. Michelle Zauner is on the feminine side of this list, and I just can’t get enough of her music.\nSpotify’s analysis finds this song to be less danceable and dark, which is exactly why Japanese Breakfast is such a curious artist project. It is experimental pop music that twists well-known pop clichés into original new songs.\nSoccer Mommy - Royal Screw Up\n“And I want an answer to all my problems”\nWhen Soccer Mommy’s new record came out in March, I could not resist reaching out to the sound engineering team to convey my congratulations. Soccer Mommy is the youngest artist on this list with a huge talent, and the team that she works with is just world class.\nPhoebe Bridgers - Kyoto\n“You called me from a payphone / They still got pay phones”\nThe most popular song on the playlist, a true global independent hit. Phoebe Bridgers is hot, and she may be a killer, too.\nDavid Kitt - It’s Yours\nSpotify sees this song as the most danceable and most positive song. And it is so.\n","date":1602950400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602950400,"objectID":"cb45c43b63bdc86900439659590ab523","permalink":"/post/2020-10-18-october_playlist/","publishdate":"2020-10-17T18:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2020-10-18-october_playlist/","section":"post","summary":"I would like to use this example as a start of series how we are thinking about connecting musicians and their fans in new ways with the help of AI and big data.

The band and the collective management organization have been working together ever since as best friends forever.\nFor me, this story is not over. A year later, the video had less than 1000 views on YouTube. How is it possible, when the Moon Moon Moon Journal Entries are so good? My startup team decided to team up with the MMM collective to figure out how it is possible that with all the might of the artificial intelligence of YouTube’s and Spotify’s algorithms this gem is not world famous yet. And yes, we are working with a sister society of Buma/Stemra in Slovakia to make this happen, who, in spite of their bad rep among artists, have been fighting with me side by side since 2016 to make this happen.\nWe decided to design an app that connects artists and their fans in a better way, using the same might of the algorithms, but working for the small band.

We will put all this information (with some clearly stated exceptions in the registration form) on the website of the experiment.\n  We will use similar data used to analyze this playlist about the participants' music.

This was a particularly difficult period for everybody. We aspired to deliver by September in a very different environment, our hopes for commissioned work went up in flames with the pandemic, and our targeted users, musicians and music entrepreneurs, talent managers, music venues lost most of their income. The organizations helping them, granting authorities, export offices and collective management societies are overwhelmed with the problem. During these troublesome times, our team expanded, attracted great new talent, and kept working.\nOur first product is the Demo Music Observatory, a collaborative, automated research-based observatory for the music industry, one that is particularly hard hit by the COVID19 crisis. Not only great artists, composers, technicians, managers fell victim to the virus, but musicians lost about 50–90% of their income from live music. This translates to a 100% loss for the live music technicians and managers.\n   See our earlier blogpost on what you see on the video.\nThe music industry was never a place for great job security. For putting up a show, you usually need a network of 10–200 artists, technicians and managers to work together as freelancers without all those social benefits that many people enjoy in other walks of life. We have been trying to figure out how to help this microenterprise and freelancer-network based industry with research for five years. Our aim is to make them competitive when they are talking with their buyers: Google, Apple, Spotify, who are really heavy-weight data and AI pros. Our better plan their tours, when they will be back on the road, to understand what sort of audiences and purchasing power waits for them in different European cities.\nWe are launching at a time when the music industry is crying for help.Therefore, we have decided to make our demo observatory open and unfinished. Over the last 7 years, we have built up about 2000 music and creative sector indicators to be used for business KPIs, forecasting targets, grant evaluations, royalty valuations, concert demography target group analysis and other professional uses. We would like to open up, based on your needs, about 50 well-designed indicators, and pledge to keep it daily refreshed, corrected, documented, citaable, downloadable. Also, feel free to use our most valuable source code—use it for your own purposes, even modify it, as long as you keep it open.\nFor our smaller partners, we follow what musicians do these days on Bandcamp: name your price. We make a pledge to our small partners: if you need reliable data to plan your next grant calls, calculate royalties, compensations, predict hit candidates, give us the job—and name your price. Post-corona, you can take for a dollar the best music from Bandcamp. You can take our research products, for a limited period, for any amount you name, as long as it is for a good cause and serves the industry, musicians, technicians or managers. In return, we ask for your feedback. Help us validate whether we are on the right track, tell us how we can cooperate after the pandemic, in better times.\nOur larger and better funded partners? We ask you to pay the price we name, because we believe that it is a well-justified, fair and competitive price, set by pricing experts.\nWe appreciate it if you take a look at our offering, or if you pass this blogpost on to your colleagues in the industry. Our main target audience initially are music professional in broader Europe, but we are planning to cover all major global markets very soon, too. Feedback from the U.S., Australia, Canada, Colombia, Brazil \u0026amp; Argentina is particularly welcome as we have great plans over there!\nWho we are? We started our operations on 1 September 2020 on the basis of CEEMID, a pan-European data observatory that created about 2000 music and creative industry indicators for its users.

We are ready deploy public, collaborative, or private data observatories in short time.\nData processing costs can be as high as 80% for any in-house AI deployment project. We work mainly with organization that do not have in house data science team, and acquire their data anyway from outside the organization. In their case, this rate can be as high as 95%, meaning that getting and processing the data for deploying AI can be 20x more expensive than the AI solution itself.\nAI solutions require a large amount of standardized, well processed data to learn from. We want to radically decrease the cost of data acquisition and processing for our users so that exploiting AI becomes in their reach. This is particularly important in one of our target industries, the music industries, where most of the global sales is algorithmic and AI-driven. Artists, bands, small labels, publishers, even small country national associations cannot remain competitive if they cannot participate in this technological revolution.\nWe started our operations on 1 September 2020 on the basis of CEEMID, a pan-European data observatory that created about 2000 music and creative industry indicators for its users.

Our aim is to show a better organizational model, examples of research automation and other data integration innovation that can reduce the budgetary needs of the European Music Observatory by 80-90% and provide far more timely, accurate, and relevant service than most data observatories in Europe.\n  Background  Data gaps  Organization and institutional model  Quality Control  Value For Money, Budget  Use Cases  Background Data is power, and big data creates injustice. Organizations that control large amounts of data, for example, the entire listening history of hundreds of millions of people in all major countries of the world, can train algorithms and robots that drive most of the music in the world. They can make your investment into a sound recording successful or doomed. They can circumvent or help a local content regulation, reinforce, or disable a national cultural policy goal. A country may introduce national artist quotas on radio, if all the youth will be personally recommended foreign songs in their music discovery age in the very same country.\nWe believe that answer of the EU and UNESCO with the creation of permanent data collection points, so-called data observatories is correct. However, after reviewing 62 data observatories, we are convinced that many data observatories are doomed to fail.\nOur private observatory, CEEMID was consulted in the creation of the Feasibility study for the establishment of a European Music Observatory, and some of our recommendations found way into the consultant’s document. We created a Demo Music Observatory to provide a practical guidance on the decisions facing the European stakeholders, and to answer the questions that were left open in the Feasibility Study \u0026mdash; particularly on data integration and the institutional model, where a wrong choice can lead to very long delivery time, quality control and budgeting.\nData Gaps According to the feasibility study, 11% of the stakeholders consulted found that sufficient data was available for their work, 30% said that there could be more data but that does not affect their work, and 59% found that the lack of data affects their work.\nWe have shown in the Central \u0026amp; Eastern European Music Industry Report 2020, featured in the CCS Ecosystems: FLIPPING THE ODDS Conference – a two-day high-level stakeholder event jointly organized by Geothe-Institute and the DG Education and Culture of the European Commission with the Creative FLIP project.that much of the data gap is illusory: the fragmented nature of the music industry, the lack of in-house data expertise create bottlenecks in the use of the data. However, the data is present, and as it is stated in 148-149, we are willing to transfer thousands of indicators in all pillars to the future European Music Observatory.\nOur Demo Music Observatory is based on the accepted music industry concept in the US and the EU (the three-income stream model) and its data maps that we could apply to emerging markets \u0026ndash; for example, in the case of Croatia. A clear map of the industry and a clear map of the data reveals that much of the perceived gap is illusory. We would like to challenge the European music stakeholders to test us, request seemingly missing data that we will try to publish.\n  Illustration: our map to find to locate data in the Croatian music industry. Our Demo Music Observatory is based on the accepted music industry concept in the US and the EU (the three-income stream model) and its data maps.   This remains a problem with the Summary of Data Gaps on pages 128-131 that enumerate the perceived lack of data for the three pillars. We believe that these data gaps are in most cases illusory, and the remedies offered in the study are often misplaced.\nCirculation of Repertoire \u0026amp; Cultural Diversity  Streaming activity: the Feasibility Study offers Nielsen’s Global Charts as a potential solution, even though we have shown that this is not the right approach.\n The problem with Nielsen’s charts, or any chart provider’s chart, is that it covers less than 0.01% of the European repertoire, and it depicts a completely irrelevant picture for the 99.99% of the European stakeholders.\n  Illustration: our map to find to locate data in the Croatian music industry. Our Demo Music Observatory is based on the accepted music industry concept in the US and the EU (the three-income stream model) and its data maps.   We believe that the right approach, followed by our Demo Music Observatory, is a reconciliation with the work on Big Data the European Statistical System (i.e. the partnership of Eurostat and the national statistical authorities.) (See our analysis of 20 advanced, emerging and future markets in Europe.)\nChallenge Our Demo Observatory: Check out the Music Diversity \u0026amp; Circulation Pillar of our Demo Music Observatory. If you do not find what you are looking for, contact us \u0026mdash; we will try to put the data there from our repositories.\nPeople \u0026amp; Diversity  The Feasibility Study claims that “there is no real EU wide data on diversity in the music sector. Diversity should include the study of ethnic minorities, gender and vulnerable groups\u0026hellip;”\n   Illusory data gap: active and music participation is available on EU level both for gender groups or four ethnic minorities – this is regularly featured in various European CAP surveys and in our national CAP surveys, too.   However, active and music participation is available on EU level both for gender groups (see our chart) or four ethnic minorities – this is regularly featured in various European CAP surveys and in our national CAP surveys, too. Our peer-reviewed, open-source retroharmonize statistical software was developed exactly to create these data products.\nChallenge Our Demo Observatory: Check out the Music, Society and Citizenship Pillar of our Demo Music Observatory. If you do not find what you are looking for, contact us \u0026mdash; we will try to put the data there from our repositories.\nMusic Economy Because music is mainly a market activity, apart from the mainly publicly funded classical (arts) music sector, and a part of the music (stage) infrastructure, a wide variety of data is available on the music economy in a consistent manner.\nWe are calling on all partners to challenge us, either on Music Economy or the other pillars of the music observatory. We will try to provide the requested data on a weekly, monthly, quarterly or annually refreshing basis in the highest possible quality – for the first 50 request for free. We would like to demonstrate that most of the data gap is illusory, and a collaborative, bottom-up approach can deliver a European Music Observatory faster, cheaper in a much higher quality.\nChallenge Our Demo Observatory: Check out the Music Economy Pillar of our Demo Music Observatory. If you do not find what you are looking for, contact us \u0026mdash; we will try to put the data there from our repositories.\nOrganization and institutional model We believe that the biggest shortcoming of the Feasibility Study is a systematic overview of a wide range of organizational possibilities. The Feasibility Study is illustrated by examples from European Audiovisual Observatory as a good practice, investigates the possibility of integrating the music observatory into the EUIPO Observatory, and as an alternative, it considers the six product observatories of DG Agriculture \u0026amp; Rural Development. This approach provides a too narrow range of potential organizational alternatives.\nWe have reviewed a further 59 observatories, including ones that were not successful and ceased to exist, to understand why some observatories can increase their service level and why others fail. It is unclear what criteria make the European Audiovisual Observatory a good example, so it is impossible to say from this Feasibility Study if there are better examples – and we believe that there are. The EAO is one of the oldest, if not the oldest observatories. It was created before the EU was founded before the commercial internet launched, when far different legal, governance and data collection needs had to be addressed. We believe that this may be the costliest and most time-consuming model to replicate.\nBottom-up versus top-down The Feasibility Study only considers hierarchical and centralized observatories, that operate on a top-down data integration, or rather, simple data collection strategy. We have created a large observatory with a very limited budget (which has a public layer, the Demo Music Observatory, and privately funded, much larger version, CEEMID) when we realized that the centralized, hierarchical, top-down approach is not suitable for a fragmented industry like the music industry. The example of CEEMID shows that a bottom-up and collaborative approach requires far less time, budget than a hierarchical approach, and can yield superior data quality. It is not surprising that most of the 62 observatories that we have studied are not hierarchical, and not operated by a centralized body but by a Consortium of various scientific, policy and industry stakeholders.\n  The European Music Observatory should fully exploit the EU\u0026rsquo;s open data regime. (See our examples: our first open data release) Our proposal about this were quoted in the Feasibility Study.\n  It should not re-collect data that already exists. Instead it should create policies, synergies and incentives that bring that data to light. The Feasibility Study partly embraces this idea.\n  Hierarchical versus decentralized observatory We want big data to work for small venues, independent labels, startups, great and undiscovered artists. We believe that you cannot make a successful album launch, a market entry or introduce a successful cultural policy without large amounts of well processed and correctly analysed data. We want to create a Music Observatory that integrates the small data of many small bands, small labels, small venues, small countries, and mount correct the injustice. Make algorithms transparent and the competition fair.\n It should not re-collect data that already exists. Instead it should create policies, synergies and incentives that bring that data to light. The Feasibility Study partly embraces this idea. The observatory must allow a seamless data integration between open data, and highly confidential proprietary data. The Feasiblity Study wants to own and buy data, instead getting access to industry data. The open collaboration principle must allow an easy opt-in and opt-out for small and larger, public and private organizations, and offer for full transparency for all users. The Feasibility Study offers a closed observatory without opt-in.  Value For Money, Budget We believe that a bottom-up, collaborative approach of the industry stakeholders offers a much faster approach to growth, because it can mange conflicts of interests, build upon existing and trusted data assets. The annual budget of the European Audiovisual Observatory is about 3.7 million euros. Most of the European data observatories that we surveyed have an annual budget of 20,000-200,000 euros. In our view, a very comprehensive data observatory can be built from 1-3 million euros and maintained with a collaborative use of existing data assets and a subsidy of up to 200,000 euros a year.\nQuality Control   It should be transparent, the indicator design should be based on open-source statistical software. Our proposal about this were quoted in the Feasibility Study.\n  The European Music Observatory must embrace evidence-based open Policy Analysis. This topic is not considered in the Feasibility Study.\n  Use Cases We want to support the European music industry and our friends in North America, Australia, and all over the world to turn the tables with @ref(innovation) innovation coming from the open source community.\n  We want to help you to create alternative recommendation engines that actually recommend songs from your country, and we want to give you very clear export market targets with the help of AI. Our Listen Local Initiative is aiming to create recommendation engines for cities and regions, and make sure that local bands are recommended to local audiences and audiences in the regions where they will be touring after the Covid-19 pandemic.\n  We want your evidence to stand a fighting chance against large teams of professional legal and economics teams on the other side with proper valuations and damage claims.

We want to make your case that the music industry plays a vital role in the European economic recovery and job creation, because we can create economic impact assessments on GDP, employment, tax, import and export effects automatically.\n  Because music and culture are often managed at the level of cities, regions and communities, we want to give you all the data on sub-national levels, whether for regions, metropolitan areas or smaller divisions.\n  ","date":1598421600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598421600,"objectID":"188820dfb746ee447d7f25d3152a6413","permalink":"/project/music-observatory/","publishdate":"2020-08-26T08:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/music-observatory/","section":"project","summary":"Collaborative reproducible research in the music industry","tags":["ceemid","surveys","music-industry","music-observatory","reproducible-research"],"title":"Music Observatory","type":"project"},{"authors":["Daniel Antal, CFA","Réka Szentirmay"],"categories":null,"content":"The big day has come: the co-founders singed off the documents at the public notary and started the registration of a reproducible research start-up in Leiden.

Our observatory systems allow users to save thousands of working hours in data collection, in senior supervision, documentation and compliance functions. We want to help business researchers, policymakers, scientists and journalist to focus on what they do best, and use the latest, most complete, and perfectly processed information to support their work.\nOur methodology can be used in business consultancy, evidence-based policy making, social and management science and data journalism. We thrive to support all these communities, because by incorporating their different review, confirmation and auditing processing, and provide an even more reliable, robust data services to all of our users.\nReviewability means that our application’s results are can be assessed and judged by our user’s experts, or experts they trust. We not only automate data collection and cleaning, but we also automate documentation.\n Reviewability for professional consultants means that the data is always avaible with the freshest forms and with up-to-date documentation, instead of ad hoc spreadsheets collected, modified and overwritten by junior staff. The usual error-prone work that junior staff does is done by our observatory system automatically, and all the latest spreadsheets are available for all staff. Reviewability in a scientific context means that our observatory systems produce the research data in a well-documented format that adheres to the expectation of social scientific and management science peer-review. Reviewability in data journalism means that all the data is automatically refreshed and present for journalistic and editorial source-checking and analysis.  Reproducibility means that we are providing data products and tools that allow the exact duplication of our results during assessments. The most important aspect of our reproducibility is that we make the entire statistical program code either fully open source, or make the entire algorithm available for our clients. From the raw data that they give us, or we collect for them, they can arrive step-by-step to the same indicator or KPI values. Reproducibility ensures that there is no lock-in to our applications. You can always chose a different data and software vendor, or compare our results with them.\n Reproducibility in a consulting context means that our data is well-processed and described, and a senior analyst can re-create it, or even modify it to the organizations needs. In a scientific context it means that other researchers can reproduce the scientific findings which are supported by our data, because it is of high quality, well formatted and documented. In data journalism this means that journalist can reliably follow leads and sources over a longer period of time.  We are creating applications that are confirmable and auditable. These are usually required by the ethical guidelines and professional standards of our users.\nConfirmability means that using our applications findings leads to the same professional results as other available software and information. Our data products use the open-source statistical programming language R. We provide details about our algorithms and methodology to confirm our results in SPSS or Stata or sometimes even in Excel or OpenOffice. Confirmability is often a requirement of various ethical guideleins and professional standards that our clients must adhere to in the legal, economic or policy-making professions.\n Reproducibility in a consulting context means that our data is well-processed and described, and a senior analyst can re-create it, or even modify it to the organizations needs. They can confront the data with their qualitative results or parallel information bases. In a scientific context it means that other researchers can reproduce the scientific findings which are supported by our data, because it is of high quality, well formatted and documented. If any issues are raised with scientific confirmation, we assist our scientific partner to amend, replace or correct the problematic data. In data journalism this means that journalist can reliably follow leads and sources over a longer period of time. We review the entire data pipeline if our journalistic partners find contrary evidence or red flags with our data sources.  Auditability means that our data and software is archived in a way that external auditors can later review, reproduce and confirm our findings. This is a stricter form of data retention that most organizations apply, because we do not only archive results step-by-step but all computational steps – as if your colleagues would not only save every step in Excel but also their keystrokes. While auditability is a requirement in accounting, but we are extending this approach to all the quantitative work of a professional organization in an advisory or consulting capacity.\n Auditability means that we are following professional guidelines and standards of various statistical, accounting, national accounting and other professional bodies to develop our indicators and data products, and we allow auditors to review not only our data, but the entire history of the data processing, including key elements of our software code, and our general methodology. Auditability means for us that we make our critical methods and software code available for peer-review both as a software on CRAN and as a statistical method in an appropriate, peer-reviewed journal.

In popular music performers usually play their own composition and sing their own lyrics. If the musician is self-published, all the three royalties directly pay the artist’s work. If a professional publisher is helping the artist as a composer, or a record producer as a recorded performer, they usually share the respective royalty revenues. In emerging markets fewer, in mature markets more composers are represented by publishers and performers by record labels.\nClassification of Industries The nature of the creative jobs is that they contain a wide range of activities. Economists and government policymakers classify industries with the Nomenclature statistique des activités économiques dans la Communauté européenne, in short, with the NACE classification in Europe. This classification is largely harmonized on UN level and can be used to compare almost all economies in the world. The NACE classification has its origins in the economic structure of the middle 20th century, and it is more appropriate for the classification of manufacturing and trading activities, such as car manufacturing, or retail sale of cars.\nThe music industry is not even recognized by the NACE classification. For example, musicians often perform music (NACE group 90), compose music (NACE group 90), and at the same time do sound recordings (NACE group 58) and teach music (NACE group 85). Many EU member states do not even create government economic statistics for the NACE 90 classes.\nThis is the main reason why music is not well represented in governmental statistics, which is mainly based on tax returns data from ‘clear’ activity groups, such as sound recordings only. Most creative enterprises, and music businesses are no excemptions, do not have a clear economic activity.\nMicroenterprises \u0026amp; Freelancers The music industry, for various reasons, is not part of the NACE industry, and music industry data must be mapped from different data sources. A further difficulty is that music industry, similarly to the other creative and cultural industries, mainly works in freelancer networks and microenterprises. All over Europe, microenterprises are exempted from many statistical reporting, and they are filing simplified tax and financial reports.\nThe government statistics are largely based on tax returns and other filings of corporate entities with at least 5 employees. While most manufacturing or trading activities, or licensed service activities such as insurance or banking, are easy to classify, the creative industries are different. Because most creative enterprises are smaller than 5 people, they do not file many data for the government or the tax authorities, and they often carry out heterogeneous activities. For example, the music industry is not even recognized by the NACE classification – the live music and compositions can be found in the NACE 90 class, and the sound recordings in the NACE 58 class, and many countries do not even create government economic statistics for the NACE 90 classes.\nStandardized mapping CEEMID has been mapping data sources for composer, producer and performer royalties, and other data sources since 2014, based on the standard mapping technique developed originally in the United States and later adopted to the EU ^[Hull, Geoffrey P., Thomas W.

Some collective management organizations provided us with anonymous payout lists, which was essential to validate the representativeness of our samples. We reconstructed the density function of actual payouts, and collected data until our anonymous responses showed a very accurately similar shape.\nBecause the music industry all over Europe is mainly made of microenterprise and freelancers, getting an overal picture of the music industry is very difficult.\n","date":1594368000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594368000,"objectID":"9cc302a19c1bf62edafb20751399261f","permalink":"/faq/data_maps/","publishdate":"2020-07-10T10:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/faq/data_maps/","section":"faq","summary":"The copyright and neighboring right royalty is the wage-like earning of the music performer, the composer and producer.

These samples are designed to be representative for these populations, too.\nFor weighting we used the w1 weights, which allow for post-stratification based on gender, education level and community size.\nIn the case of the Republic of Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Luxembourg and Malta regionalization is not necessary because the entire countries are equivalent to a single NUTS2 region in terms of size and homogeneity. In these countries the weighting produces representative statistics.\nUnfortunately, due to a problem with the original data file, no regional information is available for the Republic of Ireland.\nIn the case of Germany, Great Britain and Italy, data can be summarized on the level of NUTS1 territories, and we are imputing these values into the constituent (smaller sub-)regions on NUTS2 levels. In the case of the remaining countries it can be summarized on NUTS2 levels.\nBecause the survey samples are designed to be nationally representative, the regional sub-samples are not necessarily representative, and often they are very small. For post stratification purposes, we created a “dirty weighting”, Using the national w1 post-stratification weights, but centered to an average value of 1 for each region.\nWe believe that this causes problems on more detailed answer options (on the level levels of the questionnaire’s question hierarchy.) Except for the science attitudes and the library quality questions, we used relatively simple questions that are less affected by the small, potentially biased sample size\nA better option would be the creation of new, regional post-stratification weights.

We’re all hoping for new information about the progress against the coronavirus. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these charts is meaningless. In fact, coronavirus case counts are meaningless, unless they are done with very heavy statistical knowledge, and even then they are very messy. Countries have different testing and hospitalization protocols, death certificating standards, and there are less and more trustworthy governments. We do not really know the severity of the local epidemics and the relative success of public health policies.\n    Nevertheless, we have some timely information on how people and the economy react to the epidemic, because there are ongoing, frequent, and comparable data sources on various consequences of the epidemic. A particularly interesting big data source is Google’s geolocational reporting on how people’s time spent in homes, workplaces, parks, shopping areas and recreational areas change. Google gets plenty of realtime data from hundreds of millions of people and compares them by days in the week and local time with the ‘baseline’ scenario before the outbreak of the coronavirus.\nBased on the locational data of various smartphones and application data, we know that people spend 10-15% more time at home since January, and 40-50% less in their workplaces. Similar data is available for other locations.\nWhile people are spending less time in the workplace and more at home in every European country, there are significant differences. Countries in the top left corner, most notable Sweden, switched less from workplaces to homes. On the bottom right corner, Spain and Italy, which were most hit by the epidemic, are in the most severe form of lockdown.\nThere are some outliers, like Romania, where people stay a lot more at home, but not so much less in the workplaces – probably they cannot afford to stay clear of the job, but they are reducing other activities. Or, in the case of Germany, people spend a lot more time in parks.\nI grouped the countries according to their dynamics. Looking at Belgium and Luxembourg, we see that they are more locked down than the typical European country, but they are moving up in the first week of April compared to the last week of March. This is very much in line with their improving strain on the health system.\nWhat is worrying is that there appears to be a significant asynchronicity in the Schengen zone, where people and goods should move around freely. The peripheric countries, which are less densely populated, often less integrated into the global transport and travel routes, are getting into the local epidemics later, and are acting later. This is logical from a national point of view, but given that the European economy is very much integrated, it will prolong the pain. The Netherlands, France and Germany need plenty of seasonal agricultural workers from the Southeast, where the lockdown is just getting really strict. While some of their regions see improving national epidemic situations, the easing will increase the intensity of the local epidemic if a large number of workers will arrive from countries that are just going into the epidemic.\nThe efficient solution, as many public health officials keep saying, would be a synchronized effort to contain the virus. The different pace and strictness of social distancing measures will mean that the local epidemics will not be in synchronization, and the countries will re-infect each other, this way prolonging the economic and social cost of this devastating pandemic. While health policy is a national competence in the European Union, in fact, the European economic and social life is so much integrated, not only within the Schengen Zone, but even with future, prospective and candidate members states in the Balkans, that a far more coordinated public health policy would be required.\nUse this in your article?

Our CEE Music Industry Report 2020 created with the help and support of Consolidated Independent was used as a use case for the problems.\nThis blog post is an edited version of Daniel\u0026rsquo;s presentation and the subsequent panel discussion with the stakeholders and organizers.\nThe CEE Report builds on the results of the first Hungarian, Slovak, Croatian and Czech music industry reports are compared with Armenian, Austrian, Bulgarian, Lithuanian, Serbian and Slovenian data and findings.\nInvisibility The measurement problems and the ‘invisibility’ of creative and cultural industries is a consequence of the fact that these industries are predominantly comprised of microenterprises and individual, freelancing entrepreneurs. Even larger entities, such as collective management organizations can be classified as small enterprises. In the EU, small- and medium enterprises, and especially microenterprises usually have reduced reporting duties to the statistical authorities and tax authorities (which is the most important secondary source of government statistics in anonymized, aggregated form.) This means that the supply side is not visible for policymakers. The recommendation is to conduct sample-based surveys among these microenterprises, but very few member states do that.\nAnother problem is that on the demand side, not all member states create statistics. ESSNet-Culture created recommendations how to measure cultural access and participation, which is a broader term than cultural consumption, as it includes non-market forms, for example, liturgical music, amateur acting, and so on. The European Commission sometimes makes excellent, but not detailed CAP surveys, which are the most important sources of Eurostat’s relevant pan-European statistics.\nCEEMID has been making such surveys, both on the supply side (in music and film) and in the audience side (in music, film, theatre, opera, and artistic activities) in several member states, and has plenty of experience with using the EU-mandated CAP surveys of 2007 and 2013. The CEE report relies on the latter date set in first part of the audience analysis. Our work was already presented in 2015 as a best use case in Creating better national cultural statistics with Eurobarometer datasets and ESSNet-Culture technical recommendations at GESIS, which maintains the Eurobarometer archives, on the Eurobarometer Symposium Four Decades of Surveying Europe – Perspectives on Academic Research with the European Commission’s Eurobarometer Surveys\nFor the EU the lowest hanging fruit would be to critically assess the past surveys, including the partial CAP survey made in 2017 for the cultural heritage part of culture, and the national surveys conducted by CEEMID and its partners, and to mandate an annual or biannual CAP survey within the Eurobarometer series, probably as a specially sampled “Special Eurobarometer”. This would very significantly reduce the costs compared to a country-to-country basis, and probably could be shared by other institutions, for example, with the European Audiovisual Observatory. This alone would greatly increase the demand / consumption side information on the services of creative and cultural enterprises.\nIn the panel discussion Consolidated Independent highlighted the problem of leaving sample-based statistics making to the industry itself, which leads to myopical incentives to create ‘policy-based evidence’ that is cherry picked by industry trade associations to fit their often not very well thought out policy agenda. In our view, the most important role of a future European Music Observatory would be to set standards to data collection and integration. The music industry is one of the most data-rich industries globally, but the publicly available, verified, trustworthy information is scarce both for policy-making and for business planning among microenterprises who have know specialized research know-how. Our already existing, representative national surveys should and could be extended to the whole Europe with the quality control and visibility offered by such an Observatory.\nIndustry organization A very significant challenge with evidence-based policymaking, or, in fact, with any policy making is that the extremely fragmented nature of the industry makes national and EU-level consultations very difficult. Most of the workforce is neither a classical employer nor employee but works as a freelancer or a micro-entrepreneur. Their views are very rarely represented by trade unions or employee associations or chambers of commerce. Despite all efforts on EU level to make the social dialogue more representative for atypical and flexible work forms, the problems and the views of the creative and cultural sectors are largely unrepresented in policy debate.\nA prime example of this problem is the very heavy over-taxation of the music industry that we have shown in the Hungarian and Slovak national music industry reports, and in other documents in Croatia. The problem is not only characteristic for the music industry, but generally all CCIs because they share similar economic properties: no real chance to use tax breaks, high level of labour input and high level of value added. While policy makers and granting authorities spend much time on trying to improve the financing of this sector, in fact, reducing over-taxation would make a much more imminent impact on the liquidity, profitability and growth opportunities of the sector.\nHowever, in the making of economic and tax policies, the fragmented creative and cultural industries hardly can represent their special situation.\nPolicy issues Apart from taxation issues, which significantly reduce the liquidity, profitability and growth opportunities of these sectors in many EU countries, particularly in the CEE, where corporate taxes are low but value-added taxes are high, there are other important policy problem that reduce the long-term growth capacity of the sector.\nThe very small enterprise size leads to missing strategic human resources (HR) and research and development (R\u0026amp;D) functions in almost all enterprises – including simple market research activities. Companies with 1-2 employees do not have specialized management and support functions, and thus they have a very strong handicap in HR and R\u0026amp;D.\nA good example of this problem is the motion picture and TV industry. These industries were comprised of medium-sized enterprises in the 1980s with significant in-house education functions. The current structure of these industries, however, resembles music, with almost all enterprises staying below the 5-person threshold. In our experience, based on development needs assessments in the Hungarian motion picture and the Czech music industry, this creates an acute skills and labor shortage. Missing skills cannot be well replaced by recruitment, or with strategic HR development via life-long learning.\nSimilarly to very reduced opportunities to participate in, and create life-long learning schemes, there are very little chances to engage in market research and R\u0026amp;D. While the music industry, for example, is one of the most data-driven industries in the world, the microenterprise size does not allow that these enterprises commission market research or hire data scientists. This leads to very asymmetrical relationships with the main distributors of music and media content on platforms that are owned by global data companies.\nRecommendations Daniel made a few concrete recommendations in the panel.\n  Creating the European Music Observatory, and the creation of similar industry initiatives, and commissioning collaborative (multi-stakeholder) market research, as CEEMID works in many countries, can only replace the missing market research function in the extremely fragmented industries, such as motion picture production, the music industry, but to a certain degree architecture and design.\n  A low-hanging fruit would be a critical assessment of the previous Pan-European CAP surveys and the comparable national CAP surveys conducted by CEEMID and its partners following the ESSNet Culture recommendations and the inclusion of the CAP surveys in an annual or bi-annual form in the Eurobarometer (Special) series. A Special Eurobarometer may be more suitable because usually a non-proportional weighting of the sample gives the best value for money in these surveys.\n  Critically reviewing the participation of micro-enterprises in the current forms of social dialogue and looking for formal or informal ways to increase participation in policy making can gradually lead to more creative-friendly economic regulation and tax policies. The Hungarian Music Industry Report 2015 and the Slovak Music Industry Report 2019 contains very interesting case studies for this problem that we briefly summarize in the CEE Music Industry Report 2020.\n  Critically reviewing the few examples from mainly Nordic member states where collective agreements and other collaborative institutions allow microenterprises and freelancers to participate in life-long learning problems can help designing policies that will gradually reduce the huge skill gap of the CCIs in management know-how, data know-how, or renew their technical skills necessary in the production of their services and content. Our work with the Hungarian National Film Fund and surveys among more than a thousand film makers can give much insight into this problem.\n  Further links Our research findings were earlier presented and discussed in Vienna, Prague, Budapest and Bratislava with stakeholders.\nYou can follow Creative FLIP project on Twitter.\n","date":1580310000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580310000,"objectID":"e16a23b156aca94ce649126c85162b8d","permalink":"/post/2020-01-30-ceereport/","publishdate":"2020-01-29T16:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/2020-01-30-ceereport/","section":"post","summary":"The Central \u0026 Eastern European Music Industry Report 2020 was presented as a case-study on national and comparative evidence-based policymaking in the cultural and creative sector.","tags":["market-report","music-industry","CCI","CEEMID","opendata","Armenia","Austria","Bulgaria","Czechia","Lithuania","Hungary","Slovakia","Serbia","music-observatory"],"title":"CCS Ecosystems: Evidence-Driven CCI Policy \u0026 The Central \u0026 Eastern European Music Industry Report","type":"post"},{"authors":["Daniel Antal"],"categories":null,"content":"The predecessor of Reprex\u0026rsquo;s Demo Music Observatory, CEEMID together with the independent music distributor Consolidated Independent presented and discussed with stakeholders the Central \u0026amp; Eastern European Music Industry Report 2020 as a case-study on national and comparative evidence-based policymaking in the cultural and creative sector on the CCS Ecosystems: FLIPPING THE ODDS Conference – a two-day high-level stakeholder event jointly organized by Geothe-Institute and the DG Education and Culture of the European Commission with the Creative FLIP project.\nThe CEE Report builds on the results of the first Hungarian, Slovak, Croatian and Czech music industry reports are compared with Armenian, Austrian, Bulgarian, Lithuanian, Serbian and Slovenian data and findings.\nOur research findings were earlier presented and discussed in Vienna, Prague, Budapest and Bratislava with stakeholders.\nYou can find the earlier presentations in the blog section of the website.\nExecutive Summary The first Central European Music Industry Report is the result of a co-operation that started among stakeholders in three EU countries five years ago to measure the economic value added of music – the basis of a modern royalty pricing system. This gave birth to CEEMID, originally the Central \u0026amp; Eastern European Music Industry Databases, a data integration programme that now in 2020, covers all of Europe. CEEMID fulfils similar roles to the planned European Music Observatory and supports all pillars of the future pan-European system.\nThe comparison of Western and Eastern music audiences reveals key demographic differences that make the unchanged adoption of business practices from mature markets in the region questionable. Chapter 2 of this report will show these differences and their consequences on music markets, in terms of visiting and acquisition likelihood, frequency, seasonality and purchasing capacity. This is an example of how CEEMID fulfils the role of Pillar 3 (music, society and citizenship) in the planned European Music Observatory.\n Chapter 3 contrasts market demand with the supply strategies of musicians. CEEMID has been surveying music professionals, including artists, technicians and managers about their working conditions, market conditions and plans for five years across a growing number of countries. In 2019 we invited 100 national and regional stakeholders to distribute our surveys. In some countries, our surveys already have several years of historic data, making the resulting musician database probably the largest ever source of data about how music is produced and how musicians live. We are constantly looking for partners to roll out this survey to new countries in new languages.\nThe CEE region has comparative advantages in big music events like festivals, and it has become one of the most important hubs for cultural tourism in the world. We explain this phenomenon in Chapter 4 by showing the differences in demand composition, demography and supply of venues in the second chapter. The lack of a modern and dense network of permanent music venues gave rise to magnificent music festivals in the CEE. Open’er, Sziget and Exit are among the biggest and best festivals in the world, closely followed by several smaller festivals in all countries. The share of festivals in the live music market is many times higher than in Western Europe and they provide vital export revenues to the local music economies. However, they play a limited role in finding new audiences for local artists, as they are increasingly programming for Western audiences by providing shows of international hits. They can only very partially fill in the gaps left by the small venue problem that hit the emerging markets harder than the UK or Australia, where policy action had been already taken to reverse the decline of the availability of smaller live music venues.\nOn the recording side, our analysis shows that modern digital services are growing at a faster rate than in mature markets. Because of lower repertoire competition, streaming quantities are similar for a typical Austrian, Czech, Hungarian, Polish or Slovak track than in the mature markets. However, revenue growth is limited because of the interplay of several analysed factors. Our analysis of the live and recorded music markets shows that CEEMID fulfils the roles of the Pillar 1 (music economy) of the planned European Music Observatory.\nMost recorded music sales revenue in the region comes from streaming platforms, just like in the mature markets. Successful sales strategies require a solid knowledge of the global marketplace and the ability to understand and train sales algorithms. Micro-enterprises, such as independent labels, have very limited ability to cope with these functions, given that they do not have market research or R\u0026amp;D functions. CEEMID and Consolidated Independent have started initiating open, national R\u0026amp;D consortia to create the necessary concentration in data assets, analytical capacity and budgets to close this gap. As a first step, CEEMID and Consolidated Independent have created a large, independent music dataset based on hundreds of millions of royalty statement entries to create our market indexes, styled after stock market and bond market indexes. Streaming opportunities are fast changing as roll-out of streaming services is happening at a different rate in various territories; subscription charges and the exchange rate to the producer’s currency vary and repertoire competition emerges in the market. Our volume and revenue indexes in Chapter 5.3 are aimed at creating sales algorithms that optimize sales volumes and expected revenues. We believe that this analysis also reveals that CEEMID partially fulfils the roles of Pillar 2 (music diversity and circulation) and feeds important data into Pillar 4 (innovation).\nThe region has far bigger untapped potential than most music business executives believe. Households in the region spend a significantly lower share of their recreational budget on music than their Western, Southern or Nordic peers. The region has a lot of untapped cultural purchasing power because servicing is particularly challenging in both the live and recorded sides of the business.\nThis upside potential cannot be tapped without better pricing. Royalty levels are often very low in the region. Due to many combined effects analysed in this short report, the gap between royalties earned in the CEE and Western Europe is several times bigger than the difference in GDP or national average wage. These gaps are partly caused by special interests preventing collective management from charging appropriate tariffs for restaurants, media companies or electronic appliance importers and manufacturers, and partly by unfavourable taxation of cultural products and services.\nCEEMID was designed to create economic evidence on royalty pricing, private copying compensation and the creation of economic value added in the industry. In the first Hungarian Music Industry Report of ProArt and in the first Slovak Music Industry Report we have shown that economic and taxation policies of the CEE countries aimed to support car and electronics manufacturing create a distorted, unfavourable economic regime for creative industries. We want to help local stakeholders with economic evidence to correct these discriminatory policies during the overhaul of the EU VAT system. We have been helping various national organizations with economic evidence, presented in the light of latest EU jurisprudence, to improve their pricing activities. Our thousands of indicators were also used in ex ante evaluations of granting schemes.\nIn 2020, all EU member states will change their copyright administration legislation because of the national implementations of the 2019/790 Digital Single Market directive. CEEMID provides evidence in several countries about the size and impact mechanism of the value transfer, and generally the widespread use of the copyright exemption for private copying. We believe that the thousands of pan-European music industry indicators that we have aggregated over the five years will play a vital role in these regulatory processes.\nCEEMID fulfils its roles with a very thorough exploitation of the EU’s 17-years-old Open Data regime with the re-use of public sector information, and a very careful mapping of the music industry. These maps help us conduct annual surveys among musicians and the audience, and they help us connect (always with pre-approval and with a user mandate) to industry databases. We do not only cover the EU countries, but increasingly (potential) candidate countries and neighbourhood countries.\nIn our vision, this data collection and integration, i.e. Pillars 1-3 should be available for all music stakeholders, should remain public and publicly funded. The last Pillar of the observatory, innovation, is where private entities should compete. The founders of CEEMID and Consolidated Independent believe that this report demonstrates the business and policy benefits of such a system with the analysis of the Central \u0026amp; Eastern European music markets. We believe that this way CEEMID is in a position to serve most of the planned functions of the envisioned European Music Observatory, and we are looking for ways to make either our thousands of indicators, or our data collection and integration software open source and available for all stakeholders in the EU and its neighbours. CEEMID was born out of necessity to level out the different levels of public research and statistical coverage of the EU member states. In our view, private entities in the future should focus their investments in Pillar 4 of the planned observatory, i.e. competing in innovation with creating new models, algorithms and services based on data that is available throughout the European Union without giving further advantage to the already mature markets.\n","date":1580310000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580310000,"objectID":"5ee96ab1e81941d29fc0164f71dc9a4b","permalink":"/publication/ceereport_2020/","publishdate":"2020-01-29T16:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ceereport_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The results of the first Hungarian, Slovak, Croatian and Czech music industry reports are compared with Armenian, Austrian, Bulgarian, Lithuanian, Serbian and Slovenian data and findings.","tags":["market-report","music-industry","Armenia","Austria","Bulgaria","Czechia","Lithuania","Hungary","Slovakia","Serbia"],"title":"Central \u0026 Eastern European Music Industry Report 2020","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Antal, CFA"],"categories":null,"content":"I was presenting some highlights from the work we started with in the organization of SoundCzech with 25 music professionals representing more than 20 stakeholders in the How We Would Like To Work in the Czech Music Industry in 2020 ex ante evaluation workshop in the context of the comparative Central European Music Industry Report.\nYou can find the full presentation, including slides not shown in the workshop here.

In the absence of a fully functional recording market, musicians are more reliant on collective management revenues than in the rest of Europe – yet in many countries collective management has profound difficulty in asking the correct price for music or collecting it.\nWhen analysing the music flows among European countries, and the export-import flows of other emerging markets in Latin America and the worlds most stable ones, like that of the United States, Brazil and Japan, we must realize that these nations face an uphill battle to get into the better paying markets and at the same time to protect their domestic market from increasing import substitution.\nMusic grants could be an important tool to balance the disadvantaged position of CEE musicians in this global competition. Austria and Hungary has a strong popular music support program, but usually the availability and suitability of grants is lower in those countries where musicians and their technical and managerial team would need it most.\n I am very grateful for the support given by Consolidated Independent in the making of this report. CI is the market leader in managed services for the digital music industry, connecting the best independent music with the opportunities of the global market. With their data science team, we put together data from about 700,000,000 royalty statement documents about the whole region. I believe that this is the first time that a global player releases large amounts of data to help understanding the changing music landscape in the era of digital streaming.

I always felt that however dynamic are those charts, artists keep complaining that they do not feel these developments. So I started to decompose those growth figures.\nThe Global Music Report quotes national streaming revenues on a dollar basis, which contains a lot of currency exchange noise. And behind the national total there are too many factors: subscriber base growth and repertoire growth and the subscription fee. The interplay of these forces is unpredictable. Whenever a local artist or producers sees a 10% reported national growth, they can never be sure if this will likely cause their sale to grow or shrink.\nBecause of the changes in the subscriber base and the available competing repertoire, it is important to see if the artist’s segment is growing, and if the competition is growing. The sales platforms will never reveal such data, and anyway, there is a competition among many sales platforms. I was looking for an analogy for a similar problem. Securities are a bit similar to songs, they will produce later cash flows, and they are competing for an always changing number of investors and with a constantly changing competition in the investible universe. Songs and their royalty flows exhibit similarities with both equity and bonds, and I believe that a good solution is the creation of song indexes, similarly to stock and bond indexes that represent the performance of various security classes. After many hours of work with the state51 data science team, and at least as much processing work for the servers, we came up with a dataset that contained data from about 700 million royalty statements. I designed a sampling method that is far from perfect, but I think it gives a first birds-eye view on the European markets.\nIn every country and every month, we selected those exploited songs that were in the middle of the exploitation range: as many songs were less listened to as many were more listened too. For simplicity, I call those selected songs the ‘typical songs’ for each streaming platform and royalty territory. I added together the streaming quantities on the three major platforms. For every territory and month, this could have been the sales of a ‘typical’ song.\nLike stock and bond indexes, we can create even more relevant indexes for certain rightsholders. In the Central European Music Industry Report, we will present for each territory a ‘domestic’ and a ‘foreign’ index, because the sales potential of a Slovak song in Slovakia or in Austria is very different from a British song in Slovakia or Austria. In Slovakia, a Slovak song is on a home territory and in Austria in a near territory, while the British song is on one of the almost 200 territories.\nThese findings will be open to discussion on Waves Music Showcase Festival and Conference [click for details] on 27 September 2019.\n","date":1569258000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569258000,"objectID":"085c4e184686adf1eb7a13000ec8bd1e","permalink":"/post/2019-09-24_streaming-market/","publishdate":"2019-09-23T19:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2019-09-24_streaming-market/","section":"post","summary":"Total national sales reflect the growing number of subscribers, the price, the exchange rate, and many factors that are not important for an artists or music label.

For comparison, we added a similar, middle-income emerging market (Argentina) and a rich, small-population English-speaking country, Australia to the chart. These countries seem to be in a similar position to the CEE countries.\nArguably, the strongest countries of songwriting are the United States and Brazil - these are the countries that have ran out of the ISRC recording identifier range. Their charts are full with their domestic songs, but they are not alone. Japan, France, and the bigger EU countries, France, Germany and Poland have very strong domestic performance, too.\nOf course, there are many factor at play here. Large countries with large artist populations generate a lot more recordings, so they local fans always have thousands of new songs to select from. In small countries, the total annual creations, from pop to jazz, from authentic folk to classical amounts to a few thousand tracks. But it is not only size that matters. Sweden\u0026rsquo;s population is similar to that of Austria, Hungary and Czechia, yet the Swedish repertoire performs better in Sweden, and as we will see in the next chart, abroad, too.\nWe created a second data animation to visualize how hits were travelling across the borders in the summer of 2ö19. To make the chart easier to read, we omitted the United States, Brazil and Japan as countries of origin, and concentrated only on intra-European hit flows.\nThe second week of September 2019 was not an exceptional week. Most EU countries' producers did not score any hits in any other EU countries' Spotify Top 50 hits. The UK exported many great hits to all over Europe, as usual, but there were other important hit flows. These hits mainly follow cultural proximity.\nFrance exported hits to the two Francophone countries of Europe, Belgium and Romania, and furthermore to Greece, a Southern country with particularly unique chart composition. Germany exported many hits to Austria, another German-speaking country, and some hits to other Germanic countries. Dutch producers placed a few hits in the Germanic countries and in Belgium, where the Dutch-speaking Flemish community has its own radios, TVs, press and hitlists. The Netherlands is a powerhouse of electronic popmusic that are not bound by language which finds audience in several countries.\nThe strength and competitive position of the national market where an artists is most known and has a fan base is usually a determining factor of track performance and revenue. The overall revenue prospects and competition situation of a Hungarian or Croatian song is very different from a British or even a Polish song. But overall, most European recordings are not bound to a domestic country. Because of cultural proximity, the presence of native minorities or new immigrant diasporas, even small-language songs are being listened to on a much wider territory than the artists' original country. Some relatively small EU countries, such as Sweden and the Netherlands successfully export their music on a regular basis.\nNevertheless, as the streaming services slowly overtake all other forms of use, the charts above depict a very fundamental market change. Whereas in the traditional channels of physical sales, digital downloads and broadcasting, the CEE countries, like other small- and medium-sized EU countries, enjoyed 30-50% market share, among the streaming hits their producer\u0026rsquo;s share is below 10%. It is not unusual to find only domestic recordings in physical sales hitlists, while domestic songs rarely enter the streaming charts in the region, with the exception of Poland.\nThe traditional sales channels protected CEE markets in several ways. After EU accession most import duties are gone, but physical products have very significant logistics costs, which gives local producers a competitive edge. Because physical products are increasingly sold on concerts and festivals, where the market share of domestic performers is usually very high, the traditional, mechanically licensed sales had a protected market.\nThe broadcasting channel, which used the be the most important promotion channel, too, was protected in many European countries by national content quotas, or supported with generously funded national, regional, local public broadcasters who gave a preference to national composers, producers and performers. These market barriers are not present in the streaming markets, which poses many questions. Our research is aiming to answer these questions, but it took several years to build a data infrastructure that can help producing an accurate market overview.\n   These findings will be open to discussion on Waves Music Showcase Festival and Conference [click for details] on 27 September 2019.\n","date":1568968200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569256200,"objectID":"4739be7819abcab2e47b964e45e5ff38","permalink":"/post/2019-09-23_cross-border_europe/","publishdate":"2019-09-20T10:30:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2019-09-23_cross-border_europe/","section":"post","summary":"Which are the European countries that can successfully export songs on a streaming platform?

This is a very good starting point because it makes comparable the rough material standards of musicians and other professional groups in the EU, irrespective of local earnings and living costs.\nMusicians everywhere, including rich countries like Germany, Austria and Slovenia have more problems with paying their bills than the general population in their countries. The only seemingly different country is Bulgaria, but in this case, the self-reported difference is small, and generally Bulgarian musicians and other Bulgarian people have similarly frequent difficulties with paying their bills.\nWorking in an emerging economy is more stressful than in a mature economy – making ends is more difficult, risks are greater and usually rules change faster. No wonder that people generally report higher level of life satisfaction in countries where the living standards are also higher: average life satisfaction in a country is greatly influenced by national income and general health level, measured by life expectancy. However, it is also recorded since the 1970s that after reaching a certain level of living standards, life satisfaction does not increase further with economic conditions. Other factors, such as vocation, work-life balance and political factors play a role, too. Working in an emerging economy is more stressful than in a mature economy – making ends is more difficult, risks are greater and usually rules change faster.\nIn the emerging music business countries, it is very important to see that the musicians not only earn little money, but as freelancers their income is mainly based on live performances, peaking in the festival season and in December. This income is usually taxed at far higher rates in the CEE region than in Western Europe or in non-creative industries. Royalties, which should balance variable live performance earnings are far lower both as a percentage of total musician income and in euro terms than in advanced markets. This is often coupled with higher taxation, too.\nTo avoid the bias of higher satisfaction levels in richer environments, we measure musician’s self-reported life satisfaction levels against the national averages from the 2018/11 Eurobarometer sample, scaled between the numerical values of -2 (not at all satisfied) to 2 (very satisfied).\n  Comparing the life satisfaction levels of musicians with the general public, 2018-2019.   Our comparison shows that in most of our surveyed countries, musicians are more satisfied with their lives than the average person, despite having more material difficulties. Of course, age, and other factors can contribute to this, but a vocational calling is certainly an important aspect, too. The exceptions are, interestingly, Austria and Slovenia, where the general population has a very high level of life satisfaction, and where both musicians and the general public are generally more satisfied with their lives than in the other countries. In these cases, compared to the general population, music professional are less satisfied with their lives. In Serbia our sample is too small to draw real conclusions.\n  Comparing the difficulties of paying bills among musicians and the general public, 2018-2019.   Career in music can lead to higher life satisfaction than other similarly paid jobs in Europe. However, music market stakeholders should focus on increasing the level of music professional earnings and reducing its variance within the year and over the years, because the material living conditions of musicians is significantly worse than the conditions of the general population.\nYou can read a lot more about this research here.\n","date":1563724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563731100,"objectID":"b58b684f2c8a1aea2e2a4e251b2f4877","permalink":"/post/2019-07-21_life_satisfaction/","publishdate":"2019-07-21T18:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2019-07-21_life_satisfaction/","section":"post","summary":"Career in music can lead to higher life satisfaction than other similarly paid jobs in Europe.

However, defying some economic expectation, to growth is stronger in mature markets than in most emerging markets, and most of the global growth came from the United States. The dollar-based IFPI Global Music Report hides the fact that mature and emerging Europe is truly lagging behind the United States.\nThe European music scene is very fragmented, has many languages and the lack of critical market size often leads to neglect by innovative global players. In a world where most music is soled by big data driven algorithms in subscription streams, the lack of large repertoires, data analytics capabilities and critical audience masses puts the smaller European repertoires into a competitive disadvantage.\n   We had a very interesting discussion that will lead to hopefully many new initiatives on a number of problems, including low market prices in collectively managed and private channels, distribution problems, the difficulties and opportunities in regional cooperation and a number of other topics.

Spotify pays out about 20% of its royalties to publishers. Because the labels are the bigger stakeholders, they often do not provide the necessary information for work identification in the case of publishers.\nDominic from Netflix is already one of the biggest buyers of music, and I believe that his company’s footprint will just continue growing. His time buys licenses only 10% of their music from publishers. They mainly use original film music, and to a significant degree, catalogs.\nBen made a presentation about their innovation efforts at ICE digital rights management. Working with some of the largest repertoires represented by PRS, GEMA and STIM, they really offer world class services. Next year they promise to scale services to smaller repertoires, who can immediately benefit from low-cost identification from the cleaned data of these large societies.\nDigital gap between household cultural spending and CE / S European music industry revenues in the digital world Comparing household cultural spending with digital music revenues in Europe’s main regions.\nDaniel’s short presentation highlighted the fact that the CEE region’s is much richer in terms of household cultural and recreational spending that it is thought by the music industry, because the music industry is really lagging its Western and Nordic peers in tapping into this pool of money. There are many reasons for this, all a bit touched upon the other speaker’s issues, and their implementation difficulties n the CEE region, especially different revenue stream breakup, strong collective management and relatively underdeveloped publishing.

After several years on the stage musician’s got a recording contract, and usually even later they registered their first composition. The recording stream was the most important revenue source. The making of a record was expensive and offered considerable royalties or advances.\nIn the 21st century the live music stream is far more important than the recordings. Creating recordings is much cheaper and stage performances are expensive. Musicians usually create their music, also register it as a music work and offer it to the public on an online portfolio of mp3 downloads, YouTube and music streams. Often they are booked for their first live performance after publishing a recording.\nWhat does it mean for the musician and the manager? First and foremost that traditional career development strategies do not work anymore. A convincing stage performance is mandatory with a good touring strategy. Recordings are often not profitable, but equally important in building the audience. Making the recording stream a revenue stream instead of the cost stream requires a very good understanding of the costs and benefits of the different digital channels. CEEMID also contains market information on these issues.\nCareer information in CEEMID\n  Milestones of the musician’s career\n  Level of professionalization, secondary career paths\n  Income level and basic live standards information\n  Production and concert volumes\n  Revenue breakup in all the three major income streams, i.e. publishing, recording and live.\n  The data is available for Croatia, Hungary and Slovakia.

The presentation was largely based on analysis of various CEEMID databases.\nThe Central European music industry, as shown by processing the data of more than 2000 musicians in the region is even more reliant on live performances than the British music industry. Even though Croatia appears to be more similar to the UK than the region, a deeper analysis of the data reveals that this is not the case. The most important difference between mature markets and emerging markets is the lack of good distribution and monetization strategy for recorded music.\nCollecting and analyzing industry data is very important for small, national music industries that do not have a large enough repertoire that can be easily promoted on global platforms such as Spotify, Deezer or YouTube. New digital platforms produce relatively low income for Central and Southeastern European artists and labels, but they are growing at a rate similar to mature markets with a short, 1-5 years lag. Understanding the different strategies of global service providers, forthcoming liberalization and data-driven analytics are very important to maintain the share of domestic music in the radio and television channels and further expand it in the new channels.\nMore insights will be published on our blog and the forthcoming Regional music industry report.

Our mandate was to create concrete granting proposals that have a high chance of making a change in terms of the later royalty earning capabilities of artists.\nIn the first phase of the project, we made two workshops with the eight fields development method to understand the challenges and existing working practices that result in a low level of royalties paid out in Hungary. This methodology requires a groupwork of all stakeholders and professionals of the industry. In this case, we worked in groups of 30-40, covering various artists, stage, light, sound technicians, producers, managers and even band transporters. One group predominantly was Budapest-based and one in Eastern Hungary, to have a different view on working and market conditions in the metropolitan city and in the countryside. While royalties are not applicable for live music, it was well understood by the granting authority and the music industry that royalties cannot grow without a healthy live music sector in the country.\nIn the workshop, the consultant with several aides facilitates a very structured conversation that starts with a desired state of the industry which is not described by slogans but by actual characterizations of a desired working environment. Instead of envisioning that “everybody gets a grant”, we describe the ideal project planning and management cycle of a new tour or record to see how a granting can fit into this workflow and what type of grants add effective assistance to realize goals. For each goal and change we envision how that effects the work of the performing artists, her manager, the technician crew, even the schedule of the tour bus driver. We discuss if the change makes any material change in the way we can prepare for a new album release.\nIn the latter stages what sort of changes we envision in day practices, programmers, institutions and what concrete steps are needed to be made to get there. As a controlling step, we assign indicators that can be objectively judged, and which can show the degree of change if recommended actions are taken.\nThe advantage of the eight-fields methodology, which was originally developed to support EU and global aid program design is that it allows conflicting viewpoints, finding consensus, and display very highly detailed policy and program scenarios already in a day. It is generally a very enjoyable experience for artists and professionals. If the workshop takes place over 2 days, a first draft program is already presented on the second morning and by the end of the day participants usually have a detailed program. In this case, we came up with dozens of concrete proposals, many of which could be addressed to the stakeholders themselves without any action taken from the granting authority.\n     In the next stage we carried out the annual CEEMID Music Professional Survey with additional questions where artists, managers and technicians could rate the proposals. They could also optionally give their next year development priorities in the fields of live performances, recordings and composition, in the context of their current work, pre-existing financing and professional assistance of financial assistance needs. In Hungary, more than 1000 music professionals filled out the survey in 2015.\nAt the end of the workshop and the survey, we could present a very comprehensive policy and granting program, with preliminary estimates on granting needs, ideal and minimum grant sizes, and grant contractual conditions to avoid grant calls that cannot be contracted out to winners due to unrealistic prerequisites.\nThese results, with suggested cultural policy indicators, program indicators and budgetary outlines were presented to the granting authority of the Cseh Tamás Program (currently named: Hangfoglaló Popular Music Support Program)\n","date":1447351200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1447351200,"objectID":"ca02b5b7594b75124728d1397149b66d","permalink":"/post/2015-11-12-cstp/","publishdate":"2015-11-12T19:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/2015-11-12-cstp/","section":"post","summary":"The data and intelligence of CEEMID was used in Hungary to create an ex ante evaluation of the new Cseh Tamás Program to support popular music development in Hungary.

CVM surveys result in well-behaved demand curves for music in public places. Tariffs can be directly validated. Choice modeling reveals that consumers demand music and are rather insensitive to its price. Tariff levels are generally approved. Hedonic pricing reveals the different value added by different restaurants, bars, etc. – crucial for good value proposition and risk sharing with differentiated tariffs.
