Ex-post data harmonization enables better use of existing data and creates new research opportunities. For example, harmonizing data from different countries enables cross-national comparisons, while merging data from different time points makes it possible to track changes over time.\nRetrospective data harmonization is associated with challenges including conceptual issues with establishing equivalence and comparability, practical complications of having to standardize the naming and coding of variables, technical difficulties with merging data stored in different formats, and the need to document a large number of data transformations. The retroharmonize package assists with the latter three components, freeing up the capacity of researchers to focus on the first.\nSpecifically, the retroharmonize package proposes a reproducible workflow, including a new class for storing data together with the harmonized and original metadata, as well as functions for importing data from different formats, harmonizing data and metadata, documenting the harmonization process, and converting between data types. See here for an overview of the functionalities.\nThe new labelled_spss_survey() class is an extension of haven’s labelled_spss class. It not only preserves variable and value labels and the user-defined missing range, but also gives an identifier, for example, the filename or the wave number, to the vector. Additionally, it enables the preservation – as metadata attributes – of the original variable names, labels, and value codes and labels, from the source data, in addition to the harmonized variable names, labels, and value codes and labels. This way, the harmonized data also contain the pre-harmonization record. The stored original metadata can be used for validation and documentation purposes.\nThe vignette Working With The labelled_spss_survey Class provides more information about the labelled_spss_survey() class.\nIn Harmonize Value Labels we discuss the characteristics of the labelled_spss_survey() class and demonstrates the problems that using this class solves.\nWe also provide three extensive case studies illustrating how the retroharmonize package can be used for ex-post harmonization of data from cross-national surveys:\nAfrobarometer Arab Barometer Eurobarometer The creators of retroharmonize are not affiliated with either Afrobarometer, Arab Barometer, Eurobarometer, or the organizations that designs, produces or archives their surveys.\nWe started building an experimental APIs data is running retroharmonize regularly and improving known statistical data sources. See: Digital Music Observatory, Green Deal Data Observatory, Economy Data Observatory.\nCitations and related work Citing the data sources Our package has been tested on three harmonized survey’s microdata. Because retroharmonize is not affiliated with any of these data sources, to replicate our tutorials or work with the data, you have download the data files from these sources, and you have to cite those sources in your work.\nAfrobarometer data: Cite Afrobarometer Arab Barometer data: cite Arab Barometer. Eurobarometer data: The Eurobarometer data Eurobarometer raw data and related documentation (questionnaires, codebooks, etc.) are made available by GESIS, ICPSR and through the Social Science Data Archive networks.

At the same time, the Commission conceded that the EU would have to increase its pools of quality data available for use and re-use. In the creative industries, this need for enhanced data quality and interoperability is particularly strong. Without data improvement, unprecedented opportunities for monetising the wide variety of EU creative and making this content available for new technologies, such as artificial intelligence training systems, will most probably be lost. The problem has a worldwide dimension. While the US have already taken steps to provide an integrated data space for music as of 1 January 2021, the EU is facing major obstacles not only in the field of music but also in other creative industry sectors. Weighing costs and benefits, there can be little doubt that new data improvement initiatives and sufficient investment in a better copyright data infrastructure should play a central role in EU copyright policy. A trade-off between data harmonisation and interoperability on the one hand, and transparency and accountability of content recommender systems on the other, could pave the way for successful new initiatives.\nThe published article: https://www.jipitec.eu/issues/jipitec-13-1-2022/5515\nPreprint version The earlier preprint version on SSRN our for direct download here on Data \u0026amp; Lyrics.

I love record stores - I used to have a collection of CDs, and my father a collection of vinyl’s. Are record store’s important locations in your project? Do you have a favorite record shop?\nIt’s actually the first time we made an Open Studio Session in a record shop. And it felt very natural. Record shops are a very important place for me I’m trying to build one, dedicated to independent artists and record labels, in Toulouse, where I live. So, it means a lot to me, that we made this Open Studio Session with Suzanne Belaubre in The Walrus Record shop. The most inspiring record shop I have seen are in London. The one from Erased Tapes, is very small but very special to me.\nThe other thing I liked a lot about your project is that it brings the attention to the importance of localities, that music ecosystems are usually small geographies. Not all artists have a global fanbase, or can go on an international tour, even if there is no pandemic. How do your project fit into local ecosystems?\nAs you said, a lot of artists have a local fan base and even when artists are big, they always have a special bond with the audience and the city they come from. The idea behind the Open Studio Sessions is to allow artists to open up in front of a very restricted audience and show themselves from a creative and working perspective. They put themselves in a vulnerable position and the audience gets to be very close to the artists. I believe it’s a way for people to see their local artists from a new perspective.\nSuzanne Belaubre recording her performance in the Walrus Record shop. Photo: Daniel Antal We both tried to further develop our projects in JUMP. What was the most important learning for you in these 9 months, when you were together with other entrepreneurs, trainers, mentors and visited several music cities?\nOne of the most important things I’ve learned through this program is to dare. Dare to contact people, dare to ask for help. When you get to meet loads of professionals of the music industry in such a short time, you realize, you’re going to have to be quick, seize the moment to dare talk with them and share your ideas, your ambitions. This program also pushed me to recruit people to work with to become more efficient in my work.\nThe Open Studio Sessions. started out from a documentary film project. What happened with the film?\nThat’s true. I started to produce a documentary series. I made a pilot episode and three episodes of that documentary series. Each episode following a new artist through the making of a song. I had been discussing possibilities of diffusion with a production company and a French TV channel. After a few months the TV channel had changed their mind and I was already getting started with the Open Studio Sessions, which were working pretty well. So, I decided to suspend the documentary series. Maybe I’ll get back to it one day. The episodes I made are still available on YouTube.\nJeremy Dunne in the Open Studio Session of The Walrus Record shop. Photo: Daniel Antal Do you have any ambitions to extend your project beyond France, to Belgium or even further to us in the the Netherlands?\nI would to. I’m currently working on the first Open Studio Session Tour in France. The next step would be to make a European Open Studio Session Tour. I already collaborated with a few Belgium artists when working on the documentary series. It would be an honor to work with them again.\nLinks Suzanne Belaubre Jeremy Dunne - JUMP Fellow 2021 Facebook: From Play to Rec YouTube Channel for From Play to Rec JUMP European Music Market Accelerator ","date":1638536400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638536400,"objectID":"bf7344a9ed07e1e6dc274cb5f4442ceb","permalink":"https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-12-03-rec_to_play/","publishdate":"2021-12-03T14:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/2021-12-03-rec_to_play/","section":"post","summary":"Jeremy Dunne is the founder of the French Open Studio Sessions, which allows artists to open up in front of a very restricted audience and show themselves from a creative and working perspective---during they are producing a recorded performance.","tags":["JUMP Europen Music Market Accelerator","record shops","recording","independent labels"],"title":"From Play to Rec","type":"post"},{"authors":["Daniel"],"categories":null,"content":"Public data sources are often plagued by missng values. Naively you may think that you can ignore them, but think twice: in most cases, missing data in a table is not missing information, but rather malformatted information. This approach of ignoring or dropping missing values will not be feasible or robust when you want to make a beautiful visualization, or use data in a business forecasting model, a machine learning (AI) applicaton, or a more complex scientific model. All of the above require complete datasets, and naively discarding missing data points amounts to an excessive waste of information. In this example we are continuing the example a not-so-easy to find public dataset.\nIn the next blogpost we explain how we added value by documenting data following the FAIR principle and with the professional curatorial work of placing the data in context, and linking it to other information sources, such as other datasets, books, and publications, regardless of their natural language (i.e., whether these sources are described in English, German, Portugese or Croatian). Photo: Jack Sloop. Completing missing datapoints requires statistical production information (why might the data be missing?) and data science knowhow (how to impute the missing value.) If you do not have a good statistician or data scientist in your team, you will need high-quality, complete datasets. This is what our automated data observatories provide.\nWhy is data missing? International organizations offer many statistical products, but usually they are on an ‘as-is’ basis. For example, Eurostat is the world’s premiere statistical agency, but it has no right to overrule whatever data the member states of the European Union, and some other cooperating European countries give to them. And they cannot force these countries to hand over data if they fail to do so. As a result, there will be many data points that are missing, and often data points that have wrong (obsolete) descriptions or geographical dimensions. We will show the geographical aspect of the problem in a separate blogpost; for now, we only focus on missing data.\nSome countries have only recently started providing data to the Eurostat umbrella organization, and it is likely that you will find few datapoints for North Macedonia or Bosnia-Herzegovina. Other countries provide data with some delay, and the last one or two years are missing. And there are gaps in some countries’ data, too.\nSee the authoritative copy of the dataset. This is a headache if you want to use the data in some machine learning application or in a multiple or panel regression model. You can, of course, discard countries or years where you do not have full data coverage, but this approach usually wastes too much information–if you work with 12 years, and only one data point is available, you would be discarding an entire country’s 11-years’ worth of data. Another option is to estimate the values, or otherwise impute the missing data, when this is possible with reasonable precision. This is where things get tricky, and you will likely need a statistician or a data scientist onboard.\nWhat can we improve? Consider that the data is only missing from one year for a particular country, 2015. The naive solution would be to omit 2015 or the country at hand from the dataset. This is pretty destructive, because we know a lot about the radio market turnover in this country and in this year! But leaving 2015 blank will not look good on a chart, and will make your machine learning application or your regression model stop.\nA statistician or a radio market expert will tell you that you know more-or-less the missing information: the total turnover was certainly not zero in that year. With some statistical or radio domain-specific knowledge you will use the 2014, or 2016 value, or a combination of the two and keep the country and year in the dataset.\nOur improved dataset added backcasted (using the best time series model fitting the country’s actually present data), forecasted (again, using the best time series model), and approximated data (using linear approximation.) In a few cases, we add the last or next known value. To give a few quantiative indicators about our work:\nIncreased number of observations: 65% Reduced missing values: -48.1% Increased non-missing subset for regression or AI: +66.67% If your organization is working with panel (longitudional multiple) regressions or various machine learning applications, then your team knows that not havint the +66.67% gain would be a deal-breaker in the choice of models and punctuality of estimates or KPIs or other quantiative products. And that they would spent about 90% of their data resources on achieving this +66.67% gain in usability.\nIf you happen to work in an NGO, a business unit or a research institute that does not employ data scientists, then it is likely that you can never achieve this improvement, and you have to give up on a number of quantitative tools or …","date":1636362000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636624860,"objectID":"64c18e37a183412e97b5041bcadff5d2","permalink":"https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-11-06-indicator_value_added/","publishdate":"2021-11-08T10:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/2021-11-06-indicator_value_added/","section":"post","summary":"Public data sources are often plagued with missng values.

This is an important demand driver in the Music economy pillar of our Digital Music Observatory, and important indicator in our more general Cultural \u0026amp; Creative Sectors and Industries Observatory. We show a very similar example in our Green Deal Data Observatory with environmental R\u0026amp;D public spending in Europe.\nThis dataset comes from a public datasource, the data warehouse of the European statistical agency, Eurostat. Yet it is not trivial to use: unless you are familiar with national accounts, you will not find this dataset on the Eurostat website.\nThe data can be retrieved from the Annual detailed enterprise statistics for services NACE Rev.2 H-N and S95 Eurostat folder. Our version of this statistical indicator is documented following the FAIR principles: our data assets are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. While the Eurostat data warehouse partly fulfills these important data quality expectations, we can improve them significantly. And we can also improve the dataset, too, as we will show in the next blogpost.\nFindable Data Our data observatories add value by curating the data–we bring this indicator to light with a more descriptive name, and we place it in context with our Digital Music Observatory and Cultural \u0026amp; Creative Sectors and Industries Observatory. While many people may need this dataset in the creative sectors, or among cultural policy designers, most of them have no training in working with national accounts, which imply decyphering national account data codes in records that measure economic activity at a national level. Our curated data observatories bring together many available data around important domains. Our Digital Music Observatory, for example, aims to form an ecosystem of music data users and producers.\nWe added descriptive metadata that help you find our data and match it with other relevant data sources. We added descriptive metadata that help you find our data and match it with other relevant data sources. For example, we add keywords and standardized metadata identifiers from the Library of Congress Linked Data Services, probably the world’s largest standardized knowledge library description. This ensures that you can find relevant data around the same key term (radio broadcasting) in addition to our turnover data. This allows connecting our dataset unambiguosly with other information sources that use the same concept, but may be listed under different keywords, such as Radio–Broadcasting, or Radio industry and trade, or maybe Hörfunkveranstalter in German, or Emitiranje radijskog programa in Croatian or Actividades de radiodifusão in Portugese.\nAccessible Data Our data is accessible in two forms: in csv tabular format (which can be read with Excel, OpenOffice, Numbers, SPSS and many similar spreadsheet or statistical applications) and in JSON for automated importing into your databases. We can also provide our users with SQLite databases, which are fully functional, single user relational databases.\nTidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This makes the data easier to clean, and far more easier to use in a much wider range of applications than the original data we used. In theory, this is a simple objective, yet we find that even governmental statistical agencies–and even scientific publications–often publish untidy data. This poses a significant problem that implies productivity loses: tidying data will require long hours of investment, and if a reproducible workflow is not used, data integrity can also be compromised: chances are that the process of tidying will overwrite, delete, or omit a data or a label.\nTidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. While the original data source, the Eurostat data warehouse is accessible, too, we added value with bringing the data into a tidy format. Tidy data can immediately be imported into a statistical application like SPSS or STATA, or into your own database. It is immediately available for plotting in Excel, OpenOffice or Numbers.\nInteroperability Our data can be easily imported with, or joined with data from other internal or external sources.\nAll our indicators come with standardized descriptive metadata, and statistical (processing) metadata.

Even an estimate would require a very complex methodology. Understanding the earnings of an average rights-holder would require a careful disaggregation of volume, price, exchange rate, and distribution changes, and international data harmonisation.\nEstimating average or typical income requires advanced empirical sampling or surveying methods. The Digital Music Observatory (previously CEEMID) has worked on developing such methods, with the support of the state51 music group. We commissioned a report from the Digital Music Observatory on the earnings of UK rights-holders and this can be found here at \u0026lt;the Digital Music Observatory’s Zenodo repository\u0026gt; Among the Observatory’s findings are that use of streaming services is generally growing in terms of volume, but the price is diminishing, which leads to diminishing or flat earnings for a typical or average British rights-holder; that in the 2015-2019 period, falling prices were partly or fully compensated by favourable changes in the exchange rate of the British pound with major currencies used in the global music business (the US dollar, the euro and the Japanese yen), but since 2020 there may have been changes in the opposite direction; and that for various methodological reasons, without international data harmonisation, and survey harmonisation, it is impossible to take a fully representative, unbiased sample of music creator earnings in the United Kingdom alone.” Music Creator’s Earnings in the Digital Era, p28.\nExectuive Summary of Our Research Document The research questions asked in this report are related to the Music Creator Earnings’ Project (MCE), exploring issues concerning equitable remuneration and earnings distributions. We were tasked with providing a longitudinal analysis of earnings development and relating our findings to equitable remuneration. The starting point of our work was centred around a very broadly defined problem: how much money music creators (rightsholders) earn from streaming, how these earnings are distributed, and how the earnings and their distribution have developed during the last decade.\nThe highly globalized music industry generates two important international reports, as well as several national reports, but these are not suitable for the analysis of the typical or average rightsholder, nor for small labels and publishers who do not represent a large and internationally diversified portfolio of music works or recordings. Copyright and neighboring right revenues are collected in national jurisdictions. Because British artists are almost never constrained by their use of language, and the UK Music Industry is highly competitive in the global music markets, even relatively less known rightsholders earn revenues from dozens of national markets. The lack of market information on music sales volumes, prices for each jurisdiction, and the unaccounted for national, domestic, and foreign revenues makes the analysis of the rightholder’s earnings, or the economics of a certain distribution channel like music streaming or media platforms, impossible.\nWhile total earnings are reported by international and national organizations, they hide five important economic variables: changes in sales volumes, changes in prices, market share on various national jurisdictions (which have their own volume and price movements), the exchange rates applied, and the share of the repertoire exploited. Even worse, the global music industry has no comprehensive database of rightsholders, music works, and recordings. Many rights are represented by heirs or passive investors. And because of the enormous number of works and recordings, in any given royalty payment period, most works/recordings are not used and not compensated. The lack of a known population and distribution makes usual indicators as average or median earnings arithmetically impossible to compute, and the large number of disused works and recordings makes even the estimation of the typical (median) value useless for economic analysis. The estimation of the arithmetic mean is equally problematic, because it is distorted by the earnings of very few global stars. To understand the streaming economy from the perspective of a typical or average rightsholder, or from the perspective of a small independent label or music publisher, requires very challenging sampling techniques either in surveying or in empirically observing and aggregating data from royalty accounts.

First, we show that in the era of global music sales platforms it is impossible to understand the economics of music streaming without international data harmonization and advanced surveying and sampling. Paradoxically, without careful adjustments for accruals, market shares in jurisdictions, and disaggregation of price and volume changes, the British industry cannot analyze its own economics because of its high level of integration to the global music economy. Furthermore, the replacement of former public performances, mechanical licensing, and private copying remunerations (which has been available for British rightsholders in their European markets for decades) with less valuable streaming licenses has left many rightsholders poorer. Making adjustments on the distribution system without modifying the definition of equitable remuneration rights or the pro-rata distribution scheme of streaming platforms opens up many conflicts while solving not enough fundamental problems. Therefore, we suggest participation in international data harmonization and policy coordination to help regain the historical value of music.\nContext The idea of our Digital Music Observatory was brought to the UK policy debate on music streaming by the Written evidence submitted by The state51 Music Group to the Economics of music streaming review of the UK Parliaments’ DCMS Committee1.\nThe music industry requires a permanent market monitoring facility to win fights in competition tribunals, because it is increasingly disputing revenues with the world’s biggest data owners. This was precisely the role of the former CEEMID2 program, which was initiated by a group of collective management societies. Starting with three relatively data-poor countries, where data pooling allowed rightsholders to increase revenues, the CEEMID data collection program was extended in 2019 to 12 countries.The final regional report, after the release of the detailed Hungarian, Slovak and Croatian reports of CEEMID was sponsored by Consolidated Independent (of the state51 music group.)\nCEEMID was eventually to formed into the Demo Music Observatory in 20203, following the …","date":1632384000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633597200,"objectID":"8938f6147e394da8e229f796e9ff1272","permalink":"https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-09-23-mce_reports/","publishdate":"2021-09-23T08:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2021-09-23-mce_reports/","section":"post","summary":"Our Digital Music Observatory contributed to the Music Creators’ Earnings in the Streaming Era project with understanding the level of justified and unjustified differences in rightsholder earnings, and putting them into a broader music economy context.

She is also a performing artists, whose music is connected to different parts of Europe. We interviewed her because of our shared interest in how music crosses borders.\nSo, you’re currently living in Prague, after spending several years located in France, London, and Berlin. What was this journey like for you?\nI got locked down in Prague actually. I intended to move to Berlin after leaving London, as my pianist lives there and has kids. It seemed like the best next destination, but it just didn’t work out. Lockdown came out of the blue and I decided to stay in Czech Republic. I eventually found an apartment in Prague and a job I’ve wanted to do all my life, so I think this is it.\nI now work for a label and I am in charge of our sync \u0026amp; publishing department. My professional focus is still abroad for the most part which helps me work towards my ambitions, yet also come back to my roots. I feel like this is what I really needed for my creativity to strive.\nWhere would you like to find an audience for your music?\nThat’s a great question, one that is hard to answer in my case since I am local in several places. I would say that because my songs are in English and draw inspiration from Irish and British folk music - I started writing when I found Lisa Hannigan and her melody based songs - they will resonate with people in these territories more than they probably will in Czechia.\nI consider myself a storyteller. My music is a space to communicate emotions about experiences we might not always talk about. I love performing live and I can see myself doing this anywhere, but mostly in Europe. I feel very close to all the countries I’ve lived in, so France and even the UK. I always build a small fanbase where I live, and then uproot again.\nMarie on stage I would like to spend more time in Central and Eastern Europe too. I feel like I neglected these countries and quite unfairly so. This has been a challenge as touring is always an expense, and since I collaborate with a pianist who has two children, there are practical aspects that I have to consider.\nHowever, I am not performing much these days. I channeled all my passion for it into my work with other artists and have been a booker, a manager, a filmmaker, a producer, an event organiser, and just kept on learning about the industry whilst swimming in it.\nListen Local tries to connect local musicians with local music. Can we say that you are looking for audiences that can be reached from Berlin and Prague, so Western Czechia and the Southeastern part of Germany? Our app is designed to find out where you music mind find audience, and for music lovers, to find artists who are close enough to visit on a small venue gig.\nYes, you could say this is the territory where I would like people to listen to my music. I released my songs which were recorded eight years after we wrote them. Spotify became more dominant in release strategy and I had very little understanding of how it worked, what to pay attention to and how much time goes into release planning. I just decided to put the songs up, and let them live their own life. Now that I know much more about digital, I want to be more intentional about the songs I put out and how I do it. I love visual expression, I love collaboration, and I feel that the spaces I choose to live in – which I choose because they are beautiful – play an important role in this. I want to tell the story of how everything lead to where I am now. I always figured it was important to highlight small artist locally and where they performed so that audiences could connect with them and follow them long after, so what you are doing is great.\nHaving moved around, what do you consider home, in a spiritual or physical sense?\nFrance is really my sacred place. It is a place where I feel insanely inspired and at home. Even from miles away, it gives me a sense of confidence and freedom. I lived in the mountains for six years, and I loved it because it was a place where you needed to rely on yourself to survive. There is no industry there so anything I wanted to exist, I had to create everything myself. And that was amazing, because I proved to myself that I could do anything I decided to. When you are in a city, you always have to ask permissions. As a woman in this industry, no one listens to you. You have to work triple hard for people to let you say or do something.\nI come back to the mountains for consolation, really. I even changed my French surname to mean “from the mountains,” as a way for people to stop focusing on where I am from and more on what I do. It worked, and I became Marie De La Montagne. I identified with that name so much, I had a hard time using my civil surname in my professional life when I became a publisher. Me and my colleague had a lot of laughs about it.

This is the price that project managers and analysts pay for the inadequate documentation of their data assets. When was a file downloaded from the internet? What happened with it sense? Are their updates? Did the bibliographical reference was made for quotations? Missing values imputed? Currency translated? Who knows about it – who created a dataset, who contributed to it? Which is an intermediate format of a spreadsheet file, and which is the final, checked, approved by a senior manager?\nBig data creates inequality and injustice. On aspect of this inequality is the cost of data processing and documentation – a greatly underestimated, and usually not reported cost item. In small organizations, where there are no separate data science and data engineering roles, data is usually supposed to be processed and documented by (junior) analysts or researchers. This a very important source of the gap between Big Tech and them: the data usually ends up very expensive, ill-formatted, not readable by computers that use machine learning and AI. Usually the documentation steps are completely omitted.\n“Data is potential information, analogous to potential energy: work is required to release it.” – Jeffrey Pomerantz\nMetadata, which is information about the history of the data, and information how it can be technically and legally reused, has a hidden cost. Cheap or low-quality external data comes with poor or no metadata, and small organizations lack the resources to add high-quality metadata to their datasets. However, this only perpetuates the problem.\nThe hidden cost item behind the unbillable hours As we have shown with our research partners, such metadata problems are not unique to data analysis. Independent artists and small labels are suffering on music or book sales platforms, because their copyrighted content is not well documented. If you automatically document tens of thousands of songs or datasets, the documentation cost is very small per item. If you, do it manually, the cost may be higher than the expected revenue from the song, or the total cost of the dataset itself. (See our research consortiums’ preprint paper: Ensuring the Visibility and Accessibility of European Creative Content on the World Market: The Need for Copyright Data Improvement in the Light of New Technologies)\nIn the short run, small consultancies, NGOs, or as a matter of fact, musicians, seem to logically give up on high-quality documentation and logging. In the long run, this has two devastating consequences: computers, such as machine learning algorithms cannot read their documents, data, songs. And as memory fades, the ill-documented resources need to be re-created, re-checked, reformatted. Often, they are even hard to find on your internal server or laptop archive.\nMetadata is a hidden destroyer of the competitiveness of corporate or academic research, or independent content management. It never quoted on external data vendor invoices, it is not planned as a cost item, because metadata, the description of a dataset, a document, a presentation, or song, is meaningless without the resource that it describes. You never buy metadata. But if your dataset comes without proper metadata documentation, you are bound, like Sisyphus, to search for it, to re-arrange it, to check its currency units, its digits, its formatting. Data analysts are reported to spend about 80% of their working hours on data processing and not data analysis – partly, because data processing is a very laborious task that can be done by computers at a scale far cheaper, and partly because they do not know if the person who sat before them at the same desk has already performed these tasks, or if the person responsible for quality control checked for errors.\nUncut diamonds need to be cut, polished, and you have to make sure that they come from a legal source. Data is similar: it needs to be tidied up, checked and documented before use. Photo: Dave Fischer. Undocumented data is hardly informative – it may be a page in a book, a file in an obsolete file format on a governmental server, an Excel sheet that you do not remember to have checked for updates. Most data are useless, because we do not know how it can inform us, or we do not know if we can trust it. The processing can be a daunting task, not to mention the most boring and often neglected documentation duties after the dataset is final and pronounced error-free by the person in charge of quality control.\nOur observatory automatically processes and documents the data The good news about documentation and data validation costs is that they can be shared.

We automate this labor-intensive process applying the FAIR data concept.\nIn our observatory we apply the concept of FAIR (findable, accessibe, interoperable, and reusable digital assets) in our APIs and in our open-source statistical software packages.\nThe hidden cost item Metadata gets less attention than data, because it is never acquired separately, it is not on the invoice, and therefore it remains an a hidden cost, and it is more important from a budgeting and a usability point of view than the data itself. Metadata is responsible for industry non-billable hours or uncredited working hours in academia. Poor data documentation, lack of reproducible processing and testing logs, inconsistent use of currencies, keywords, and storing messy data make reusability and interoperability, integration with other information impossible.\nFAIR Data and the Added Value of Rich Metadata we introduce how we apply the concept of FAIR (findable, accessibe, interoperable, and reusable digital assets) in our APIs.\nOrganizations pay many times for the same, repeated work, because these boring tasks, which often comprise of tens of thousands of microtasks, are neglected. Our solution creates automatic documentation and metadata for your own historical internal data or for acquisitions from data vendors. We apply the more general Dublin Core and the more specific, mandatory and recommended values of DataCite for datasets – these are new requirements in EU-funded research from 2021. But they are just the minimal steps, and there is a lot more to do to create a diamond ring from an uncut gem.\nMap your data: bibliographis, catalogues, codebooks, versioning Updating descriptive metadata, such as bibliographic citation files, descriptions and sources to data files downloaded from the internet, versioning spreadsheet documents and presentations is usually a hated and often neglected task withing organization, and rightly so: these boring and error-prone tasks are best left to computers.\nAlready adjusted spreadsheets are re-adjusted and re-checked. Hours are spent on looking for the right document with the rigth version. Duplicates multiply. Already downloaded data is downloaded again, and miscategorized, again. Finding the data without map is a treasure hunt. Photo: © N. The lack of time and resources spend on documentation over time reduces reusability and significantly increases data processing and supervision or auditing costs.\nOur observatory metadata is compliant with the Dublin Core Cross-Domain Attribute Set metadata standard, but we use different formatting. We offer simple re-formatting from the richer DataCite to Dublin Core for interoperability with a wider set of data sources. We use all mandatory DataCite metadata fields, all the the recommended and optional ones. It complies with the tidy data principles. In other words: very easy to import into your databases, or join with other databases, and the information is easy to find. Corrections, updates can automatically managed.\nWhat happened with the data before? We are creating Codebooks that are following the SDMX statistical metadata codelists, and resemble the SMDX concepts used by international statistical agencies. (See more technical information here.) Small organizations often cannot afford to have data engineers and data scientists on staff, and they employ analysts who work with Excel, OpenOffice, PowerBI, SPSS or Stata. The problem with these applications is that they often require the user to manually adjust the data, with keyboard entries or mouse clicks. Furthermore, they do not provide a precise logging of the data processing, manipulation history. The manual data processing and manipulation is very error prone and makes the use of complex and high value resources, such as harmonized surveys or symmetric input-output tables, to name two important source we deal with, impossible to use. The use of these high-value data sources often requires tens of thousands of data processing steps: no human can do it faultlessly.\nWhat is even more problematic that simple applications for analysis do not provide a log of these manipulations’ steps: pulling over a column with the mouse, renaming a row, adding a zero to an empty cell. This makes senior supervisory oversight and external audit very costly.\nOur data comes with full history: all changes are visible, and we even open the code or algorithm that processed the raw data.

Ex post survey harmonization is in a way a passive form of pooling research funding because you can utilize information from surveying that were made on somebody else’s expense. The Arab Barometer surveys do not have a consolidated codebook, but our retroharmonize software created one, and put together data from three years and collected in many countries about various public policy issues. The aim of ex ante survey harmonization is to maximize the value from future retrospective harmonization; in a way, it is an active form of pooling research funding, because you benefit from money spent on related open governmental and open science survey programs. In this example we designed a survey representative among music professionals that it can be compared with large-sample, national surveys on living conditions and attitudes, and with occupational groups. Nationally representative surveys do not question enough musicians to allow such specific use; musician only surveys do not allow comparison. retorhamonize is a peer-reviewed, scientfic statistcal software that allows the programmatic retrospective harmonization of surveys, such as the last 35 years of all Eurobarometer microdata, or all Afrobarometer microdata.

Our goal is to automate this work to make open data usable at scale, even in trustworthy AI solutions. Most open data is not public, it is not downloadable from the Internet – in the EU parlance, “open” only means a legal entitlement to get access to it. And even in the rare cases when data is open and public, often it is mired by data quality issues. We are working on the prototypes of a data-as-service and research-as-service built with open-source statistical software that taps into various and often neglected open data sources.\nWe are in the prototype phase in June and our intentions are to have a well-functioning service by the time of the conference, because we are working only with open-source software elements; our technological readiness level is already very high. The novelty of our process is that we are trying to further develop and integrate a few open-source technology items into technologically and financially sustainable data-as-service and even research-as-service solutions.\nOur review of about 80 EU, UN and OECD data observatories reveals that most of them do not use these organizations’s open data - instead they use various, and often not well processed proprietary sources. We are taking a new and modern approach to the data observatory concept, and modernizing it with the application of 21st century data and metadata standards, the new results of reproducible research and data science. Various UN and OECD bodies, and particularly the European Union support or maintain more than 60 data observatories, or permanent data collection and dissemination points, but even these do not use these organizations and their members open data. We are building open-source data observatories, which run open-source statistical software that automatically processes and documents reusable public sector data (from public transport, meteorology, tax offices, taxpayer funded satellite systems, etc.) and reusable scientific data (from EU taxpayer funded research) into new, high quality statistical indicators.\nWe are taking a new and modern approach to the ‘data observatory’ concept, and modernizing it with the application of 21st century data and metadata standards, the new results of reproducible research and data science We are building various open-source data collection tools in R and Python to bring up data from big data APIs and legally open, but not public, and not well served data sources. For example, we are working on capturing representative data from the Spotify API or creating harmonized datasets from the Eurobarometer and Afrobarometer survey programs. Open data is usually not public; whatever is legally accessible is usually not ready to use for commercial or scientific purposes. In Europe, almost all taxpayer funded data is legally open for reuse, but it is usually stored in heterogeneous formats, processed into an original government or scientific need, and with various and low documentation standards. Our expert data curators are looking for new data sources that should be (re-) processed and re-documented to be usable for a wider community. We would like to introduce our service flow, which touches upon many important aspects of data scientist, data engineer and data curatorial work.

Yet, because many payout problems appear in the hard-to-describe long tail, understanding the justified differences of rightsholder earnings is an important step towards identifying the unjustified differences. It would be a breach of copyright law if less popular, or never played artists, would receive significantly more payment at the expense of popular artists from streaming providers. The earnings must reflect the difference in use and the economic value in use among rightsholders.\nIn our analysis we quantify differences using the actual data of the CEEMID-CI Streaming Indexes, created from hundreds of millions of data points, and computer simulations under realistic scenarios.\nJustified Difference \u0026amp; Changes Over Time Among the justified differences we quantify four objective justifications:\nThe variability of the domestic price of a stream over time shows a diminishing, but variable value of streams. Depending on the release date of a recording, and how quickly it builds up or loses the interest of the audience, the same number of streams can result in about 28% different earnings. In the period 2015-2019, later releases were facing diminishing revenues on streaming platforms.\nThe variability of international market share and international streaming prices in International Competitiveness. Compared to UK streaming prices, most international markets, particularly emerging markets, have a much greater variability of streaming prices. The variability of prices in advanced foreign markets such as Germany was similar to that of the British market, but in emerging markets and smaller advanced markets–such as the Netherlands–we measured a variability of around 50-80%.

I am extremely proud to announce that after a very thorough modernization of the package’s exception handling, documentation, and code dependencies that I did in the last week, the package has passed again the peer-review standards and it is back on CRAN.\nThe package is an excellent starting to point for R newbies to try their hands on musicology analysis with a few keystrokes. And of course, it is an essential part of the research infrastructure of musicology worldwide in far more advanced applications.\nGetting Started You should start with the README and get your Spotify Web API access tokens to get started.\nWhat Was the Beatles’ Favorite Key? library(spotifyr) beatles \u0026lt;- get_artist_audio_features(\u0026#39;the beatles\u0026#39;) library(dplyr) library(purrr) library(knitr) beatles %\u0026gt;% count(key_mode, sort: TRUE) %\u0026gt;% head(5) %\u0026gt;% kable() key_mode n C major 104 D major 98 G major 82 A major 76 E major 62 Get your most recently played tracks library(lubridate) get_my_recently_played(limit: 5) %\u0026gt;% mutate( artist.name: map_chr(track.artists, function(x) x$name[1]), played_at: as_datetime(played_at) ) %\u0026gt;% select( all_of(c(\u0026#34;track.name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;artist.name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;track.album.name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;played_at\u0026#34;)) ) %\u0026gt;% kable() track.name artist.name track.album.name played_at A Case of You Tristen A Case of You 2021-06-14 09:54:44 Paper Cup Real Estate Paper Cup 2021-06-10 20:20:11 Wrong with You Tristen Wrong with You 2021-06-10 20:17:24 Animal - Edit LUMP Animal 2021-06-10 20:13:21 Streets Of Your Town DOPE LEMON Streets Of Your Town 2021-06-10 18:23:00 That’s about right…\nFind Your All Time Favorite Artists get_my_top_artists_or_tracks(type: \u0026#39;artists\u0026#39;, time_range: \u0026#39;long_term\u0026#39;, limit: 5) %\u0026gt;% select(.data$name, .data$genres) %\u0026gt;% rowwise %\u0026gt;% mutate(genres: paste(.data$genres, collapse: \u0026#39;, \u0026#39;)) %\u0026gt;% ungroup %\u0026gt;% kable() name genres Japanese Breakfast art pop, bubblegrunge, eugene indie, indie pop, indie rock, philly indie Haley Bonar melancholia, stomp and holler Balthazar belgian indie, belgian rock, dutch indie, dutch rock, ghent indie Buildings Breeding indie fuzzpop Angus \u0026amp; Julia Stone australian indie folk, indie folk, stomp and holler What could I say?

One key idea behind trustworthy AI is that you verify what data sources your machine learning algorithms can learn from.

A key mission of our Digital Music Observatory, which is our modern, subjective approach on how the future European Music Observatory should look like, is to not only to provide high-quality data on the music economy, the diversity of music, and the audience of music, but also on metadata. The quality and availability, interoperability of metadata (information about how the data should be used) is key to build trustworthy AI systems.\nTraitors in a war used to be executed by firing squad, and it was a psychologically burdensome task for soldiers to have to shoot former comrades.

This is a textbook example of assigning responsibility and blame in systems. AI-driven systems such as the YouTube or Spotify recommendation systems, the shelf organization of Amazon books, or the workings of a stock photo agency come together through complex processes, and when they produce undesirable results, or, on the contrary, they improve life, it is difficult to assign blame or credit [..] If you do not see enough women on streaming charts, or if you think that the percentage of European films on your favorite streaming provider—or Slovak music on your music streaming service—is too low, you have to be able to distribute the blame in more precise terms than just saying “it’s the system” that is stacked up against women, small countries, or other groups. We need to be able to point the blame more precisely in order to effect change through economic incentives or legal constraints.\nAssigning and avoding blame, read the earlier blogpost here. This is precisely the type of work we are doing with the continued support of the Slovak national rightsholder organizations. In our work in Slovakia, we reverse engineered some of these undesirable outcomes. Popular video and music streaming recommendation systems have at least three major components based on machine learning. The problem is usually not that an algorithm is nasty and malicious; algorithms are often trained through “machine learning” techniques, and often, machines “learn” from biased, faulty, or low-quality information. Our Slovak musicologist data curator, Dominika Semaňáková explains how we want to teach machine learning algorithms to learn more about Slovak music in her introductory interview.\nRead more about our Slovak music use case here. These undesirable outcomes are sometimes illegal as they may go against non-discrimination or competition law. (See our ideas on what can go wrong – Music Streaming: Is It a Level Playing Field?) They may undermine national or EU-level cultural policy goals, media regulation, child protection rules, and fundamental rights protection against discrimination without basis. They may make Slovak artists earn significantly less than American artists.\nIn our academic (pre-print) paper we argue for new regulatory considerations to create a better, and more accountable playing field for deploying algorithms in a quasi-autonomous system, and we suggest further research to align economic incentives with the creation of higher quality and less biased metadata. The need for further research on how these large systems affect various fundamental rights, consumer or competition rights, or cultural and media policy goals cannot be overstated.\nIncentives and investments into metadata The first step is to open and understand these autonomous systems, and this is our mission with the Digital Music Observatory: it is a fully automated, open source, open data observatory that links public datasets in order to provide a comprehensive view of the European music industry.

Your application should showcase opportunities for concrete business models or social enterprises. It is also expected to find suitable new approaches and solutions to help Europe achieve important goals set by the European Commission through the use of open data.”\nWe aim to win at least one first prize in the EU Datathon 2021. We are contesting all three challenges, which are related to the EU’s official strategic policies for the coming decade.\nChallenge 1: A European Grean Deel Our Green Deal Data Observatory connects socio-economic and environmental data to help understanding and combating climate change. Challenge 1: A European Green Deal, with a particular focus on the The European Climate Pact, the Organic Action Plan, and the New European Bauhaus, i.e., mitigation strategies.\nClimate change and environmental degradation are an existential threat to Europe and the world. To overcome these challenges, the European Union created the European Green Deal strategic plan, which aims to make the EU’s economy sustainable by turning climate and environmental challenges into opportunities and making the transition just and inclusive for all.\nOur Green Deal Data Observatory is a modern reimagination of existing ‘data observatories’; currently, there are over 70 permanent international data collection and dissemination points. One of our objectives is to understand why the dozens of the EU’s observatories do not use open data and reproducible research. We want to show that open governmental data, open science, and reproducible research can lead to a higher quality and faster data ecosystem that fosters growth for policy, business, and academic data users.\nWe provide high quality, tidy data through a modern API which enables data flows between public and proprietary databases. We believe that introducing Open Policy Analysis standards with open data, open-source software, and research automation, can help the Green Deal policymaking process. Our collaboration is open for individuals, citizens scientists, research institutes, NGOS, and companies.\nChallenge 2: A Europe fit for the digital age Our Economy Data Observatory will focus on competition, small and medium sized enterprizes and robotization. Challenge 2: An economy that works for people, with a particular focus on the Single market strategy, and particular attention to the strategy’s goals of 1. Modernising our standards system, 2.

In the European Union, most taxpayer financed data in government administration, transport, or meteorology, for example, can be usually re-used. More and more scientific output is expected to be reviewable and reproducible, which implies open access.\nWhat’s the Problem with Open Data? How We Add Value? Is There Value in It? If it’s money on the street, why nobody’s picking it up? Datasets Should Work Together to Give InformationData is only potential information, raw and unprocessed. What’s the Problem with Open Data? “Data is stuff. It is raw, unprocessed, possibly even untouched by human hands, unviewed by human eyes, un-thought-about by human minds.” [1]\nMost open data cannot be just “downloaded.” Often, you need to put more than $100 value of work into processing, validating, documenting a dataset that is worth $100. But you can share this investment with our data observatories. Open data is almost always lacking of documentation, and no clear references to validate if the data is reliable or not corrupted. This is why we always start with reprocessing and redocumenting. Our review of about 80 EU, UN and OECD data observatories reveals that most of them do not use these organizations’s open data - instead they use various, and often not well processed proprietary sources. Read more: Open Data - The New Gold Without the Rush\nHow We Add Value? We believe that even such generally trusted data sources as Eurostat often need to be reprocessed, because various legal and political constraints do not allow the common European statistical services to provide optimal quality data – for example, on the regional and city levels. With rOpenGov and other partners, we are creating open-source statistical software in R to re-process these heterogenous and low-quality data into tidy statistical indicators to automatically validate and document it. Metadata is a potentially informative data record about a potentially informative dataset. We are carefully documenting and releasing administrative, processing, and descriptive metadata, following international metadata standards, to make our data easy to find and easy to use for data analysts. We are automatically creating depositions and authoritative copies marked with an individual digital object identifier (DOI) to maintain data integrity. Is There Value in Open Data? A well-known story tells of a finance professor and a student who come across a $100 bill lying on the ground. As the student stops to pick it up, the professor says, “Don’t bother—if it were really a $100 bill, it wouldn’t be there.”\nBut this is not the case with open data. Often, you need to put more than $100 into processing, validating, documenting a dataset that is worth $100.\nIn the EU, open data is governed by the Directive on open data and the re-use of public sector information - in short: Open Data Directive (EU) 2019 / 1024. It entered into force on 16 July 2019. It replaces the Public Sector Information Directive, also known as the PSI Directive which dated from 2003 and was subsequently amended in 2013.\nOpen Data is potentially useful data that can potentially replace costlier or hard to get data sources to build information. It is analogous to potential energy: work is required to release it. We build automated systems that reduce this work and increase the likelihood that open data will offer the best value for money.\nMost open data is not publicy accessible, and available upon request. Our real curatorial advantage is that we know where it is and how to get this request processed. Most European open data comes from tax authorities, meteorological offices, managers of transport infrastructure, and other governmental bodies whose data needs are very different from yours. Their data must be carefully evaluated, re-processed, and if necessary, imputed to be usable for your scientific, business or policy goals. The use of open science data is problematic in different ways: usually understanding the data documentation requires domain-specific specialist knowledge. Open science data is even more scattered and difficult to access than technically open, but not public governmental data. From Datasets to Data Integration, Data to Information “Data is only potential information, raw and unprocessed, prior to anyone actually being informed by it.” ^[2]\nWe are building simple databases and supporting APIs that release the data without restrictions, in a tidy format that is easy to join with other data, or easy to join into databases, together with standardized metadata.

We try to understand why classical musicians are paid less, or why 15% of Slovak, Estonian, Dutch, and Hungarian artists never appear on anybody’s personalized recommendations. We need to understand how various AI-driven systems operate, and one approach would at the very least model and assign blame for undesirable outcomes in probabilistic terms. The problem is usually not that an algorithm is nasty and malicious; algorithms are often trained through “machine learning” techniques, and often, machines “learn” from biased, faulty, or low-quality information.\nOutcomes: What Can Go Wrong With a Recommendation System? In complex systems there are hardly ever singular causes that explain undesired outcomes; in the case of algorithmic bias in music streaming, there is no single bullet that eliminates women from charts or makes Slovak or Estonian language content less valuable than that in English. Some apparent causes may in fact be “blank cartridges,” and the real fire might come from unexpected directions. Systematic, robust approaches are needed in order to understand what it is that may be working against female or non-cisgender artists, long-tail works, or small-country repertoires.\nSome examples of “undesirable outcomes” in recommendation engines might include:\nRecommending too small a proportion of female or small country artists; or recommending artists that promote hate and violence. Placing Slovak books on lower shelves. Making the works of major labels easier to find than those of independent labels. Placing a lower number of European works on your favorite video or music streaming platform’s start window than local television or radio regulations would require. Filling up your social media newsfeed with fake news about covid-19 spread by some malevolent agents. These undesirable outcomes are sometimes illegal as they may go against non-discrimination or competition law. (See our ideas on what can go wrong – Music Streaming: Is It a Level Playing Field?) They may undermine national or EU-level cultural policy goals, media regulation, child protection rules, and fundamental rights protection against discrimination without basis. They may make Slovak artists earn significantly less than American artists.\nMetadata problems: no single bullet theory In our work in Slovakia, we reverse engineered some of these undesirable outcomes. Popular video and music streaming recommendation systems have at least three major components based on machine learning:\nThe users’ history – Is it that users’ history is sexist, or perhaps the training metadata database is skewed against women?\nThe works’ characteristics – are Dvorak’s works as well documented for the algorithm as Taylor Swift’s or Drake’s?\nIndependent information from the internet – Does the internet write less about women artists?\nIn the making of a recommendation or an autonomous playlist, these sources of information can be seen as “metadata” concerning a copyright-protected work (as well as its right-protected recorded fixation.) More often than not, we are not facing a malicious algorithm when we see undesirable system outcomes. The usual problem is that the algorithm is learning from data that is historically biased against women or biased …","date":1620285000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621149000,"objectID":"76c746e2453286b153759760e1b7866a","permalink":"https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-05-16-recommendation-outcomes/","publishdate":"2021-05-06T07:10:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2021-05-16-recommendation-outcomes/","section":"post","summary":"In complex systems there are hardly ever singular causes that explain undesired outcomes; in the case of algorithmic bias in music streaming, there is no single bullet that eliminates women from charts or makes Slovak or Estonian language content less valuable than that in English.","tags":["algorithms","Slovakia","Trustworthy AI","recommendations"],"title":"Recommendation Systems: What can Go Wrong with the Algorithm?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Daniel Antal"],"categories":null,"content":"We use the database to monitor market developments in streaming and radio services, and to detect any problems that may lead to a disadvantageous position for Slovak artists.

The Bandcamp Dance Librarian project takes into account both classification systems, using the taxonomy of industry vendor Beatport to detect stylistic tendencies or repertoires within the Bandcamp libraries of grassroots electronic dance music labels. This is performed by identifying clusters within a Bandcamp library based on Beatport’s subgenre labels. For instance, a cluster from the library of Samurai Music is identifed as an amalgam of Drum\u0026amp;Bass, Leftfield Bass, and to a lesser extent Trap-Hip-Hop-R\u0026amp;B. The dimension of this cluster (i.e., the number of tracks) is then displayed on a timeline among other clusters.\nBandcamp is a reputable publishing platform aimed towards independent musicians that encourages the use of tags (folksonomies) by its users — accordingly, the Librarian takes into account the artist/label tags added to the Bandcamp pages. It is therefore possible to compare the industry taxonomy of Beatport with artist folksonomies, as long as such tags are provided on Bandcamp or further investigation around particular folksonomies is performed. For instance, a representative track from the cluster identified above is described, among others, as homemade weaponry by the eponymous artist:\nhomemade weaponry Bandcamp link: https://homemadeweapons.bandcamp.com/track/hawkeye\nA few more (technical) details about the project: The classifier is based on the methodology of Caparrini et al. (2020), using 92 audio features extracted from electronic dance music tracks within Beatport’s Top-100 lists in various subgenres. Bandcamp offers freely available full-length (low-bitrate) streams as track previews, which are suitable for musical feature extraction and analysis. Complete Bandcamp libraries are processed, and each track’s class (subgenre) probabilities are determined by the classifier, which forms the basis for the clustering algorithm. The number of clusters can be set in advance or calculated automatically. Results are provided in a PDF file with links to up to three representative Bandcamp tracks (if possible, from different artists) in each group and their attached tags (folksonomies).\nThe remainder of this post presents two use cases focused on localities and location tags (signifying cities, countries and sometimes nationalities). Such tags help putting local music scenes on the map; in the case of particularly prolific or creative cities they can be connected to specific genres too. Most commonly, they identify the city or country where the music label or the artist is based. Electronic music production requires relatively accessible tools and is usually carried out entirely by the producer; prominent artists are often running record labels that are integral to promoting music and structuring scenes. These aspects contribute to the burgeoning of independent music communities across the globe.\nOur first example draws on features extracted from 36 Bandcamp label libraries. The libraries are taken from a piece of music journalism (https://cdm.link/2020/05/underground-techno-labels-a-bandcamp-guide/) addressing some of Bandcamp’s “underground” techno labels that “have a sense of community, even [as] a small collective of a few friends unlikely to catch larger attention”. Such specialist music press is characterized by Canadian sociologist Sarah Thorton as niche media, which is particularly efficient in categorizing social groups, classifying sounds, defining cultural distinctions and baptizing genres. The list of labels offered in the CDM article is suitable for our current aim: a blink into the sound of “underground” techno labels based on their Bandcamp location tags.\nThe collection includes 14.200 tracks analyzed by the Librarian. A total of 97.334 tags are attached to the tracks, as illustrated by the word cloud below:\nA total of 97.334 tags are attached to the tracks In total, 12000 tags refer to locations or nationalities. The majority of the location tags designate cities — more often than not, these are where the labels are based:\nLocation Tags The following table shows the total number of tags pertaining to each location (city), and the number of labels that tagged these cities at least once within their Bandcamp library:\nTags per city (Note: United Kingdom has been conflated with London for the purposes of this illustration.)\nIn one way or another, the relative relevance of these cities within the global techno circuit can be inferred from these numbers.\nBy instructing the Librarian to treat as a single cluster all tracks that are tagged with the same city label, an attempt can be made to delineate an overall — although not the only — …","date":1618304400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618564200,"objectID":"b815b332bc4fee25895f226991c08a93","permalink":"https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-04-14-bandcamp-librarian-2/","publishdate":"2021-04-13T09:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2021-04-14-bandcamp-librarian-2/","section":"post","summary":"The second post in this series presents two use cases focused on localities and location tags (signifying cities, countries and sometimes nationalities).

In January, the co-op’s partners launched Catalytic Soundstream, a small-scale streaming platform that charges listeners $10 per month for access to a rotating library of albums from the fringes of improvised music.\nWriting as a member of Reprex, a startup that brings together the sensibilities of musicians, data scientists, ethnomusicologists, and policy scholars, I find this important initiative — in an arts and entertainment context increasingly dominated by a few large companies — inspiring, if not plain heartwarming. Here are but a few of the many reasons:\n– The impulse behind Catalytic Sound reveals something at the interface between practical and poignant about current times. The ever-growing platform economy — in which platforms are not only facilitating interactions and transactions between producers and consumers, but also becoming producers in their own right (think Netflix and Amazon making their own films and series, Spotify circumventing record labels and signing its own artists and creating its own genres) — is cornering global markets. From the point of view of listeners or viewers, options are constrained according to which platform: you can access only what you have subscribed for, and within that selection, certain recommendations are pushed to the detriment of others. Moreover, the options you are exposed to increasingly converge around the ideals of the platform owner. From the point of view of artists and media producers, being findable on certain platforms becomes essential, and this often means conforming to platform-imposed agendas and aesthetics, as Liz Pelly astutely explores.\n– The story behind Catalytic Sound reminds us that there are alternatives. Our Listen Local project shares a similar ethos: we believe that there must be better options and we take action because we realize that these alternatives will not materialize unless ideas and forms of collaboration come from new places and unconventional pools of talent. Reprex was born out of dreams similar to those expressed in Cush’s article: “What if we got together and built an alternative platform that prioritized the needs of independent musicians? What if we made the rules about who gets paid, and how?”\n– Catalytic Sound underlines the importance of openness: As Andy Cush narrates, the Catalytic Sound project started with tweets by Nipsey Hussle, in which the the late Los Angeles rapper shared how much money one million streams translated to in different streaming platforms (around $12,500 in Tidal and $4,000 in Spotify and Amazon Music). Having a sense of these numbers led to some serious coming to terms with how little musicians make through streaming, and the need to look for an alternative, no matter how modest. It’s a matter of principle: “Catalytic isn’t making any of its partners rich, but then again, neither is Spotify. (Even the $46 the musicians received at minimum last month adds up to a bigger yearly check than plenty of artists see from corporate streaming.)” At Reprex, we prioritize open data and open source collaboration as a way to build bridges between businesses, policy-makers, and academia.\nUltimately, the model Catalytic Sound is proposing is one about collaboration in which similar grassroots organizations share knowledge and work towards common goals. So far, in our Listen Local initiative, we have focused on the ways in which independent and marginalized artists can find their way on existing streaming platforms, and how listeners find locally relevant artists instead of being taken to the playlists of international superstars. Catalytic Sounds opens a new perspective— starting a new streaming service as a way of participating in that larger historical project of dismantling, rethinking, and creating, recalling what a certain Audre Lorde had to say about undoing the master’s house pdf.\nIf you read, and especially if you write on Medium, you can read and contribute to Data \u0026amp; Lyrics on the premium bloggging platform, too.\n","date":1617958800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618045800,"objectID":"5cb40d94dd32c28055fcadecb34c56d9","permalink":"https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-04-09-avantgarde-improvisers/","publishdate":"2021-04-09T09:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2021-04-09-avantgarde-improvisers/","section":"post","summary":"Catalytic Sound, a cooperative organization comprising 30 avant-garde instrumentalists and composers, is attempting to actualize this dream — and hoping to help other similarly minded musicians do the same for themselves.

At her final exhibition she was one of ten talented upcoming artists across the graduates of the three ArtEZ art academies selected to show their work at Oostenwind 11 in the Delta Lloyd building in Amsterdam. She moved to Antwerp to work in solitude and to find her creative environment. Besides making her own art, Willemijn also works as a painter on commission, as a production manager at Picoux Productions, and has been a vocalist and cellist with Verlin. She is looking for both audiences and collaborators.\nWillemijn de Krey, photo by E. Dierckx An update on on September 10, 2021. Willemijn’s debute solo single was released today: Sing for Your Lover, Matt Watts–Retrace.Yr Company.Shit\nFollow her on instagram and spotify Our initiative, Listen Local, is trying to connect local audiences with locally relevant musicians. Where do you feel at home as a musician?\nFeeling at home for me is not linked to a place, feeling at home for me has to do with connecting with people. That’s also what art is about, right? Touching people with what you do or make.\nIt’s true, though, that I feel at home in Antwerp; I did from the moment I stepped out of the train the first time I came here. There’s something about the atmosphere here, it’s sort of laissez-faire — or at least it felt that way nine years ago. It’s the reason why I wanted to live here, even though I didn’t know anyone here. The second time ever that I came to Antwerp was to move my belongings from the Netherlands to my Antwerp apartment. It was freedom, it was following my heart: on my own in a city and country I didn’t really know, choosing art above everything.\nWillemijn de Krey: Sixteen and Beautiful This is the morning of my sixteenth birthday. The first time I slept on the campsite of a music festival. Lowlands with my best friend. I hate camping, but I love music! Still glad someone found it worth it to capture this moment: “It’s your birthday!” #flash We’re eating bread with ‘schuddebuikjes’ here. In other words, “bread with minuscule cookies.” She’s wearing her skeleton hoodie and I’m wearing my Nirvana hoodie. The day before, when I was still 15, I saw PJ Harvey perform. Bless her. And bless how beautiful my friend and I were then.\n…But yeah, where do I feel at home as a musician? It’s got to do with the connection on stage and bringing it out there. It’s got to do with sincerity.\nIf people from other places would visit Antwerp, what would you recommend them to see, hear or try out? Can you recommend some local music or places?\nIn Antwerp I like Openluchttheater Rivierenhof very much. I saw Patti Smith perform there, which was kind of magical. It’s this stage in the middle of a huge park. People can sit in a semi-circle on benches or stand in front of the stage. It creates a really nice ambience.\nRecently I discovered Matt Watts’s music. At the moment he’s working on a new album with Stef Kamil Carlens as producer. The first single got released in February. And he also has another project with Nicolas Rombauts. So there are two albums of his coming out this year that I do believe are worthy of people’s attention.\nMusic performers and DJs usually start out at small local clubs and stages, and they are often constrained by the logistics of live performance. Is there any difference in building your audience as a painter? Is it important to be part of a local scene in art?\nI think pretty much everything starts from where you are located, so yes, local is the logical first step. Last July I had an exhibition in a place here in Antwerp called Who’s Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue. The owner gives courses in art, people can drink and eat something there and she has a space where every month other artists can show their work.\nWillemijn de Krey: The Rabbit Dream Two — Pink is for Punk (in private collection) The thing is that in art you have to get introduced to galleries and such by someone who has a connection with the gallery owner. Someone has to say, Hey, I think you might be interested in seeing the work of this artist, rather than going somewhere and saying, Hey, I’m an artist, want to look at my work? It also doesn’t feel right to present yourself like that, or at least for me it doesn’t.\nWillemijn de Krey: Up is the Only Way Down In this day and age it seems that everyone has to be their own businessman/woman, but in my opinion that’s somewhat ridiculous.\nI think people who have a lot of connections have a huge advantage in getting somewhere. Networking is important, but again, not everyone is good at that.\nYou are not a businesswoman, as you say, but how do you get commissions for your paintings?\nPeople approach me. Oftentimes they want to see a certain photo painted by me. It also happened that I got a commission from a friend of someone who had bought ink drawings from me. This person gave me a phrase, “men of words,” and from there I created this ink drawing in complete freedom.

The solution to this problem could be the Listen Local App, built on a comprehensive reference database of local music, which we created as a demo version within the study. The app aims to help listeners discover more local music; the app also presents new and alternative ways for large digital platforms to recommend local artists. Through Listen Local, listeners search for artists and bands based on their taste and the city they are situated in. In this way, listeners can easily search for music by artists from particular cities or from the town they are about to visit. We are releasing today the feasibility study in English and Slovak. We call for an open consultation to evaluate the results of this work and continue developing the Slovak Music Database, the Listen Local recommendation, and the AI validation system.\nCheck out the Demo Listen Local App. We explain here why.\nScreenshot of the first verison of the demo app. Database The Slovak Music Database is connected to Reprex’s flagship project, the Demo Music Observatory, an open collaboration-based demo version of the planned European Music Observatory, currently being further developed in the JUMP Music Market Accelerator Programme supported by Music Moves Europe.\nThe project website contains the demo version of the Slovak Music Database.\nDownload the Study You can download the study herein Slovak or in English.\nNext steps In the next phase of the work, we add further data to our Slovak Demo Music Database and carry out more and more experiments and educational activities to understand how Slovak music can become more visible and targeted. We are also bringing this project into an international collaboration for better utilization of R\u0026amp;D efforts and experiences throughout Europe. This agile project method originated in reproducible scientific practice and open-source software development and allows participation in large projects on any scale: from individual musicians and educators to large research universities and music distributors. Anyone can join in on the effort.\nReprex is looking for further international partners; Reprex is currently part of the Dutch AI Coalition and the European AI Alliance project. SOZA and Reprex are committed to opening this project for international collaboration while ensuring that a significant part of the R\u0026amp;D activities remains in the Slovak Republic.\nWe are preparing informal, online information sessions for artists, promoters, researchers, and developers to join our project.\nContributors The Reprex team who contributed to the English version:\nBudai, Sándor, programming and deployment Dr. Emily H.

Let the stress flow away and elevate your own frequency. Claudio is a fellow in the JUMP European Music Accelerator Program with a particularly interesting Milano and Amersfoort based startup, Flower of Sound. I visited him and his co-founder, Elise,in Seats2meet Amersfoort CS. I found their approach particularly interesting because the model of music streaming is already being overtaken by informative radio-style programming in the form of podcasts and, next to that, all sorts of functional sounds that help people to meditate, drown out noise in a co-working space, or just simply fall asleep. They made me realize that the boundary between the music market and something larger is becoming very thin, maybe disappearing.\nWhy are you talking about sound and not music? How can immersive sound have a positive affect on you?\nClaudio: We are talking about sound because we work with all kinds of auditory input, from very specific frequencies to nature sounds and ASMR (whisper voice). When you talk about music there is always a very specific assumption that there is a melody, or it is a comforting listening experience. We choose instead the possibility of healing as our core. For example, listening to just a pure tone can actually be a bit uncomfortable but it does have an effect on your body and mental state. The sound can create, for example, sonic illusions by activating certain specific areas in the brain, allowing people to recover memories of trauma from the past. Thanks to new technologies like neurofeedback we can formulate a proper sound therapy.\nWe work with immersive sound because it can have a higher positive effect than normal stereo sound for different reasons. In sound healing therapy, the different sound sources (for instance, Tibetan bowls) are often placed on the body or within someone’s energy field. With the use of spatial sound you can recreate this and let the body react in almost the same way.\nBy creating an immersive experience, you enhance the overall effect. Think of going to the cinema compared to watching a movie on your phone: it opens up a new world of creativity and unexpected effects, because it is so new, and this element of surprise and awe creates an even more positive feeling.\nWhere is the boundary between sound design and music creation? How do you end up in a ‘music market accelerator’ with a sound design project?\nWe are in an overlapping area because, with the way we have set up Flower of Sound, we are both part of the music industry and also part of the “wellbeing” world. We want to distribute all our albums via the normal streaming services from Tidal to Spotify and Amazon HD.\nAlso, we are creating a platform for a group of musicians, healers, and artists that have not found their way into the normal music world. For instance, we have recorded a sjaman playing his sound healing music, and from this we will create a spatial album and a VR experience. We will create, with the help of advanced sound design techniques, “neuro music” products for specific purposes from tantra training to stimulating neural activities, headache or nausea treatment. As you can see, we are far from music and closer to a medicine approach.\nAs a performer and as an inventor, what is the relevance of your location to you? How do you connect to your audience, your ecosystem in Milano? How will this change with virtualizing the experience?\nThe more we go virtual the more there is also a need for real life connection. So on the one end, it doesn’t matter where all of us are based, as long as we have access to high-speed internet. On the other hand, real life encounters will become more rare and precious: basically what is happening now during all these lockdowns. So it will come down to making careful decisions about when to travel to create these real life experiences, and at the same time making sure that with virtual communication channels we keep in touch and keep creating the intimacy that is needed to perform and create new projects.\nCheck out Claudio Vittori’s Collateral Nature debut album Morning Mars. The album has ten original tracks of which half are instrumental. The album is enriched with immersive contents and produced in Stereo, binaural and Dolby Atmos.\nElise, you have a background in book publishing and distribution.

Its founder, Thibaut Boudaud, is developing his project alongside our music observatory in the JUMP European Music Market Accelerator. I spoke with him on a video platform.\nHis first memories about the region are connected to his father, who served in the French zone of divided Berlin. Thibaut started to travel the region in 2008, starting with a memorable visit with Hungary’s Sziget Festival, then going further to Romania and Croatia. He has kept going back ever since: he has already visited 10 festivals in the region. On road trips with friends, on a crowdsourced fact-finding mission: he has found many ways to go back and get familiar with more and more places. I am particularly interested in Thibaut’s project, because he comes from a trajectory unknown to me, from France to the heart of the Balkans in Northern Macedonia. We have crossed each other’s routes, not yet knowing each other, on at least three occasions: on Sziget, in the summer of ’13 in Bosnia, and on the Sharpe showcase festival in Bratislava. Inspired by his travels, Thibaut went back to France to study first political science, then cultural policy, and decided to start a volunteer-based journalism website that opens up hidden aspects of the Balkans for the French readership.\nThibaut’s hajde.fr was founded as a volunteer media site in 2016. He is fascinated with the cultural richness and the generosity of the people. However challenging the living conditions of the people he has met in Albania, North Macedonia or Montenegro, they give all to the traveler, and they always want to make sure that he returns with a good memory of their city or country. Thibaut managed to meet 60 cultural stakeholders in 8 countries on his four-month fact-finding expedition [Bridges to the Balkans] that was crowdfunded on KissKissBankBank. He is the first accredited journalist to cover a number of places, including the Lovefest Festival in Vrnjačka Banja (see their Facebook page here).\nFrom an organizational point of view, the festival is functioning quite well. We may regret imperfections here and there, whether in terms of crowd management in rainy weather (expect a lot of mud), or even the behavior of security (one of the members of the editorial staff, who did not speak Serbian, was told “learn to speak Serbian” from a security guard), but the facts are there, the festival is running smoothly.\nThe stages, too, are extremely well designed, from the Fire Stage, the main stage, where a metal juggernaut spits flames, to the Energy Stage, a more convivial stage hidden among the trees, on which rising stars give their best. Soundwise, the design is flawless: even when two stages are side by side, the acoustics have been so well designed that there will be no interference. In short, enough to have a good time in front of good DJs. On a programming level, the choices are consistent. While it was still possible a few years ago to meet Balkan rock stars on stage, such as Partibrejkers in 2016 or SARS in 2012, the festival is now 100% electro, from international references such as Stephan Bodzin to rising Serbian stars like Lea Dobričić . If you are a fan of electro, you will not have much time to spare during these four days.\nThibaut is particularly interested in national showcase festivals. He visited MaMA Festival 2018 in Paris as he was working for Europavox, the first European cultural media outlet for music lovers, and had the opportunity to visit MENT in Ljubljana, Sharpe in Bratislava and PIN in Skopje. He also met Emily Gonneau, the music and tech entrepreneur and author who became a supporter of Hajde.\nThibaut started to think about professionalizing Hajde with the North Macedonian creative agency and artist group Fabricca. They had a shared vision, and eventually a grant from the French cultural ministry allowed a complete redesign of the website and social media.\nHajde is currently published by Association Hajde Creative, and relies on donations, crowdfunding and volunteers, but plans to find new revenue streams connected to tourist guides, cultural tourism, and festival tourism — among other ideas — to actually start to pay its citizen-journalists and to create more and even better content. Thibaut also wants to provide a different perspective on the region than is currently available in the French-language press. “People only hear that [Hungarian Prime Minister] Viktor Orbán is terrible, that [Serbian prime minister] Vučić is terrible. They hold very prejudiced views of Albanian or Romanian people. I want to show that there are many great things happening in the region, and there are many creative people doing great things in these countries.”\nHAJDE · #2 Destination Est - Budapest avec Julie Hajde’s founder applied to the JUMP European Music Market Accelerator to create Hajde Radio, a music-oriented podcast and radio program, but this is only viable within a …","date":1616347140,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616347140,"objectID":"4af11f1cbb83754b3e29a4382382fa16","permalink":"https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-03-21-hajde/","publishdate":"2021-03-21T19:19:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2021-03-21-hajde/","section":"post","summary":"HAJDE is a digital platform specializing in eco-responsible and cultural tourism in Eastern Europe.

Then, I used to work as an architect for Roskilde Festival in Denmark, together with my co-founder Alexander. For us, it was a great opportunity to observe the impact of our design on the festival and on the crowd behavior. We started then observing issues around and trying to find simple solutions to improve the festival environment.\nLapee gives womxn the ability to pee in a secure and clean environment without waiting in line. Apart from personal experience, what sort of research did you do to understand the scope of the problem and the potential market? How do you feed back user experience to the design process?\nWhile being at the festival that I was working for, I was extremely concerned about how difficult it was to just pee as a womxn. No matter how much fun I was having, when it comes to pee, everything turns into a nightmare because we know we’re on to a good struggle. We’ll probably lose our friends, miss half of the concert, stay in an endless line to finally lock ourselves into a sticky cabin. Many times we would go for the “other option,” commonly known as the bushes, which is quite unpleasant.\nWalking around the festival populated with male urinals, it was quite hard to understand why there wasn’t a proper industrialized solution for womxn yet.\nWhen we started drawing Lapee, we made some 1/1 cardboard models and we invited different womxn to check it out.\nCan you name another product or service that help womxn to participate more in music, either as members of the audience, or as creators, or technicians that you like?\nI think that safety is still quite an issue within the music industry. I have a friend who created an organisation, Club Mafia, which consists of having a community of people that can educate and help people in trouble or making trouble. Basically they are people in between safety guards and participants that are easier to reach out to and that are more understanding and value minded. They will listen to you if you feel uncomfortable and will go and explain to the person how not to make someone uncomfortable. I think it’s a great initiative!\nI would say that the major problems I can observe in music are sexism, queerphobia and racism, and some ideas can help fighting against them.\nSo I hope for more ideas that can improve equality. I also really hope for music organisations to speak up, be inclusive, promote better equality and not tolerate sexism, queerphobia and racism.

Music streaming platforms like Spotify, media platforms like YouTube, or alternative sales platforms like Bandcamp make around 100 million songs available worldwide.\nFrom a conservative viewpoint the fact that everything is readily exposed to us (i.e. the flooding of content) can be seen as degrading to the cultural experience; conversely, one can celebrate the growth of free digital culture, where music production and promotion is tied to less constrains, and musical experience is enriched by blogs, podcasts and other music promotion services.\nWe do not need to take sides, but we might agree that the digital explosion does not equate to instant access to relevant content — in certain cases it may trigger the opposite effect. There is so much music out there, with so many releases every week, that even professional users like radio editors, DJs or curators face challenges staying up to date. For the audience, this is even more challenging, and therefore all these platforms rely on some form of AI to make personalized recommendations or to automate the categorization of music.\nMusic might have a universal language, but finding music is rooted in natural languages, and users rely on simple verbal identifiers like genre labels. According to their broad definition, musical genres emerge as names to define similarities that identify musical events for the members of a community. These labels aid orientation within the sonic landscape, and make it easier for humans to give recommendations in a human conversation — and they are attached to extra-musical activities, too, because music is a social activity.\nOne goes to a concert and meets like-minded people, or at least there is a sense of togetherness triggered by a shared appreciation of the music. Music events are embedded into socio-cultural contexts that may prescribe forms of belonging, dress and behaviour codes, and are prone to economic regulation. Within popular music studies a range of concepts have been developed to grasp such communities, such as subcultures, neo-tribes or music scenes. One must take into account the multitude of sometimes overlapping subgenres and their varying interpretations by music lovers, which makes categorization even harder. More generic genre descriptions, like “rock” or “punk”, may sound straightforward and less confusing, but they are also less useful for uncovering complexities and nuances. More specific categories, like “darkwave” or “cold wave”, are more practical in this regard, but may sound pretty obscure or even esoteric to a non-specialist audience.\nMusic tech companies that support labels, A\u0026amp;R, music supervisors, DJs, radio editors, music journalists, and the entire music and entertainment industry, attempt to cut through the turmoil of genre labels by providing (and improving) relatively detailed taxonomies, or well-designed labels that help both humans and AI-powered robots to find and connect to music. Beatport, for example, is focused exclusively on electronic dance music, distributing its catalogue into 33 subgenres (as of Jan 2021, and counting).\nOf course, Beatport’s subgenre categories are not carved in stone. Particularly in electronic dance music, a meta-genre featuring a very high number of subgenres, such labels are often contested, and when it comes to niche genres, bottom-up, free tagging systems or folksonomies may better capture diversity and creativity, although they are less exact by their nature. These tags are rooted in the authentic, verbal descriptions of artists and promoters, and may refer to affective qualities and localities or express free associations.\nThe abundance of subgenres is a hallmark of not only electronic dance music, but also of various indie, hip-hop, jazz or other music that has lively scenes and active, emerging artists. Within electronic dance music, scholars attribute it to various factors.\nSubgenre naming can be part of a merchandising strategy, related to a top-down model of genre categorization, where taxonomies are established by vendors or industry representatives such as Beatport. It may also reflect socially accepted musical qualities and innovations; folksonomies, by their nature, are at the forefront of such stylistic innovations. Folksonomies are also supported by certain independent music promotion and marketing websites. Bandcamp, for example, is seen as a reputable platform within the indie music community, and it also provides tagging possibilities for its artists and labels. In certain cases, such tags may offer a refreshing contrast to Beatport’s genre categories.\nAs a cultural anthropologist, I have been involved in the study of alternative electronic dance music communities and event-based cultures; as is often the case, this interest has permeated into my …","date":1614949200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614949200,"objectID":"69b0db462b2ea8fa668fa539cb07c732","permalink":"https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-03-05-folksonomies/","publishdate":"2021-03-05T15:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2021-03-05-folksonomies/","section":"post","summary":"As a cultural anthropologist, I have been involved in the study of alternative electronic dance music communities and event-based cultures.

The project output also show the tags (folksonomies) added by the artists/labels to the Bandcamp pages. It is therefore possible to compare the industry taxonomy of Beatport with artist folksonomies, as long as such tags are provided on Bandcamp, and eventually create a searchable system in this kaleidoscopic musical landscape, which can be especially useful for newcomer researchers, promoters, music exporters.","tags":["Listen local","Digital Music Observatory","Library","Bandcamp","clustering","Musicology"],"title":"How to Speak About Music in the Digital Age from Taxonomies to Folksonomies","type":"post"},{"authors":["Daniel Antal"],"categories":null,"content":" According to the announcement of JUMP, the European Music Market Accelerator, after a careful screening of all applications received, the selection committee composed of all JUMP board members has selected the most promising ideas and projects to be developed together with renowned tutors for this 2021 fellowship.\nFor nine months, the 20 fellows living in many European countries will develop their innovative projects, while receiving a comprehensive 360° training.

He took part in policy debates about terrorism and military intervention and appeared on a number of TV channels including N1 (the CNN affiliate in the Western Balkans), Serbian National Television and Al-Jazeera Balkans. My research interests are at the intersection of civil war dynamics and postwar politics in the Balkans. He is going to join the Data \u0026amp; Lyrics team on International Open Data Day to help us put harmonized environmental degradation perception and environmental sensory data on maps. We asked him four questions about his passion, mapping data. Please join us 6 March 2021 9.30 EST / 15.30 CET for an informal digital coffee.\nAs a researcher, why are you so much drawn into maps? Is this connected to your interest in territorial conflicts, or you have some other inspiration?\nThat’s a great question that really makes me pause and look back at the past 5 years. My mapping story started out of curiosity: I found interesting data on the post-WWII violence in Serbia and thought how cool it would be to make a map in R. I quickly made an unimpressive choropleth map and noticed some unexpected patterns. Then I realized just how much unused violence and census data sits out there while we have no clue about geographic patterns. So, it began. I started off with map-making but my curiosity took me to the world of georeferencing and geospatial analysis. In the process, I created over 300 maps hosted on my website as well as dozens of shapefiles from the scratch.\nI used to think that my interest is linked to growing up in a war-torn country. But, as my map-making evolved, I discovered that my passion is to use maps as a way to democratize the data: to take the scores of unused, and often buried datasets, place them on the map and share the dataviz with people.\nCan you show us an example of the best use of mapped data, and the best map that you have personally created? What is their distinctive value?\nI’m immensely proud of my work that required making the shapefiles from the scratch. For instance, my shapefile of over 1500 Kosovo cadastral settlements came into being after I turned dozens of high-resolution raster files into a shapefile fully compatible with Open Street Maps. After months of hard work, I managed to merge the shapefile with the 2011 Kosovo census and present several laser-focused demographic maps to my audience. Same goes for the settlement shapefile of Republika Srpska [the Serb-speaking entity of Bosnia-Herzegovina — the editor], which I made out of a pdf file and merged with the 2013 census data. Whereas most existing maps take a bird’s eye view, my work offers a more fine-grained view of the local dynamics to stakeholders.\nAnother similar undertaking was my transformation of the pre-WWII German military map of Yugoslavia into a unique shapefile of a few hundred Yugoslav municipalities. I combined this shapefile with the 1931 census data, 80 years after it was first published (better late than never!). It took me almost a year to complete this tremendous project but I enjoyed every bit of it. I have teamed up with my brother who is a web developer and we even made an interactive map of Yugoslavia based on the 1931 census.[The screenshot of this interactive map is the top image in the post – the editor] We hope this project would serve not only scholars but also history enthusiasts to better understand a history of the country that is no more.\nCheck out Milos’s beautiful static and interactive maps on https://milosp.info/ What do you think about collaboration based on open data and open-source software that processes such data?\nIt’s a fantastic opportunity for small teams to bypass traditional gatekeepers such as state institutions or big companies and use open source apps for the benefit of their local communities. For example, the access to Open Street Map allows small teams to map pressing communal issues as crime, deceases, or environmental degradation and come up with innovative solutions. In my work, too, I used OSM has helped me create several fine-grained maps that shed more light on local problems in Serbia such as pollution, car accidents or violence.\nWe are hoping to bring together environmental, sensory data and public attitude data on environmental issues? How can mapping help? What do you expect from this project?\nMore than ever, we are compelled to figure out how maladies spreads locally. Without mapping the hotspots, our understanding of the consequences of, for example, viral transmission or pollution is shrouded with a lot of uncertainty. We might have no clue how environmental issues shape public attitudes in localities until we use the mapping to turn on the light. Mapping would help this project pin down geographic clusters that require immediate attention from the private and public stakeholders.\nPlease [join …","date":1614802980,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614802980,"objectID":"c54d327e4abb3f2b980e418fceacd701","permalink":"https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-03-03-ood_interview_maps/","publishdate":"2021-03-03T22:23:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2021-03-03-ood_interview_maps/","section":"post","summary":"Milos Popovic is a researcher, a data scientist, Marie Curie postdoc \u0026 Top 10 dataviz \u0026 R contributor on Twitter according to NodeXL.

According to the written evidence submitted by Dr. Franco Mariuzzo and Dr. Peter Ormosi to the Economics of music streaming inquiry of the UK Parliament, Digital, Culture, Media, and Sports Committee, the answer is no.\nThe researchers compared the number of streams for 719 artists represented by the major labels Sony and UMG and 1101 artists represented by independent labels to assess whether similarly popular artists had the same chance to rack up new streams over a period of two weeks.\nApplying advanced econometric techniques (you can read their publication before scientific peer-review here), the researchers ensured that the artists being compared met rigorous statistical similarity criteria. The growth prospects of artists represented by Sony and UMG do not appear to be significantly different. However, the researchers found significant differences in growth prospects when comparing artists associated with major and independent labels.\nUMG and Sony artitsts gather streams more quickly. The two companies happen to be Spotify shareholders. “One possible explanation could be that major label artists feature disproportionately in Spotify generated playlists, which gives them access to distributional channels — and consequently revenue — that indie labels do not have. Our simulation results confirm this explanation.”\nApplying a Gibrat’s law on revenue shares, the competition economists show that even if you only listen to your friend’s music in Slovakia or the Netherlands, most of the subscription fee you pay is allocated to artists such as Ed Sheeran or Ariana Grande.\nMajor label releases appear to generate more streams. UMG and Sony artitsts gather streams more quickly. The two companies happen to be Spotify shareholders. This research is consistent with the findings of the Centre National de la Musique and Deloitte, which show that the income of certain music genres that major labels invest into —such as rap and Afrobeat — receive about 20% more income than their share in streams at the expense of other genres.\nIf royalty distribution were proportional to the number of streams by listeners, classical music, hard rock, blues, pop, and rock labels and their artists would get 17–24% revenue per year. If royalty distribution were proportional to the number of streams by listeners, classical music, hard rock, blues, pop, and rock labels and their artists would get 17–24% revenue per year.\nOur own investigation with Listen Local focused on the artists who are never recommended at all and ended up on Forgetify. Our data suggests, but not yet proves, that certain countries of origin have a similar disadvantage.

The streaming platforms use a MCPS, or market-centred payout system, which is biased towards large market listeners. Contrary to UCPS, or user-centred payout systems, where all streams by all users are tallied up to determine the final distribution of subscription and advertisement revenues, MCPS uses weighted averaging that very heavily favours major music distributors and the biggest global stars.\nWe analyze these competition policy problems with Amelia Fletcher and Peter L. Ormosi in our forthcoming publication in a special issue of Competition Policy International, Music streaming: is it a level playing field?. But in the meantime, an interesting impact assessment emerged from France, because the Centre National de la Musique commissioned Deloitte to make an impact assessment on a possible change. Deezer provided a full overview of its 2019 payouts, while Spotify gave a sample of 100,000 artist payouts, and the other streaming services — for example, Apple Music — refused to cooperate with the French government-backed institution. You can read an English language summary and an excellent commentary from Emmanuel Legrand on his blog: User-centric model would not lead to significant changes in the distribution of music streaming royalties.\nWhich genres would be winners and losers in the fair payout? Fair distribution would completely alter the revenues of different genres. The biggest winner would be classical music, but various forms of pop, rock, jazz and disco artists would earn 15–25% more revenue. Currently, rap and hip-hop take about an extra 20% royalty revenue at the expense of these genres.\nThe streaming providers, which are directly or indirectly part-owned by major labels, are playing down the results, claiming that the difference would translate only to a few euros per artists at the bottom of the pyramid. In a sense, this is true, because streaming royalties are generally very low. But averaging is extremely misleading, because it includes millions of songs that are out-of-date or for another reason are never heard. In fact, entire scenes and labels would earn about 10% more revenue globally, considering that streaming revenues add up to half or even more of their total recording revenue.\n","date":1613977800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613977800,"objectID":"fd99ca26bedcf03aa433eba6b226bc05","permalink":"https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-02-21-cnm-streaming/","publishdate":"2021-02-22T09:10:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2021-02-21-cnm-streaming/","section":"post","summary":"Many people believe that if you play your favorite song again, the artist will receive more money.

It is critically important that an artist’s work is documented, described in a way that the algorithm can work with it.\nIn our research paper – soon to be published – made for the Listen Local Initiative we found that 15% of Dutch, Estonian, Hungarian, or Slovak artists had no chance to be recommended, and they usually end up on Forgetify, an app that lists never-played songs of Spotify. In another project with rights management organizations, we found that about half of the rightsholders are at risk of not getting all their royalties from the platforms because of poor documentation.\nBut how come that distributors give streaming platforms songs that are not properly documented? What sort of information is missing for the European repertoire’s visibility? Reprex is exploring this problem in a practical cooperation with SOZA, the Slovak Performing and Mechanical Rights Society, and in an academic cooperation that involves leading researchers in the field. A manuscript co-authored Martin Senftleben, director of the Institute for Information Law in Amsterdam, and eminent researchers in copyright law and music economics, Reprex’s co-founder makes the case that Europe must invest public money to resolve this problem, because in the current scenario, the documentation costs of a song exceed the expected income from streaming platforms.\nIn the European Strategy for Data, the European Commission highlighted the EU’s ambition to acquire a leading role in the data economy.

The Slovak content promoting policy was well-intended but not based on any impact assessment, and it reached its goal only partially.\nThe Slovak broadcasting quotas in comparison with other national quotas a very simple, and they are impossible to measure, which makes both compliance and enforcement very difficult. Radio editors do not get any help to find music that fits into the playlists and fulfil the quota obligations – in many cases, it is impossible for them to find out if a song actually meets the quota requirements. For the same reason, neither is enforcement possible.\nAnother deficiency of the broadcasting quotas is that because of its fuzzy target, it is not clear whom it tries to help, and it has few friends. It is unclear how performers, composers or Slovak music producers can benefit from the system. Furthermore, it only helps a few genres, and it decreases the chances of other Slovak music in instrumental and non-Slovak language genres (for example, classical, jazz, rock) to be heard.\nAnd at last, radio is losing its importance in music discovery. New generation find the music during their music discovery age on YouTube and digital streaming platforms. A Slovak content promoting policy that does not work on digital streaming platforms will be obsolete when radio content providers will switch to digital streaming in the foreseeable future.\nOur Feasibility Study follows the following logic: In the first chapter we introduce various music recommendation systems in the context of local content promotion polices, like local mandatory content quota regulations.\nIn the second chapter, we consider the market-based or creative industry economy supporting policy goals, measurements, and potential support given to artists and producers.\nWe then turn in the third chapter to content-based local regulations promoting the use of the Slovak language or Slovak music content, irrespective of the performers and producers nationality, residence or ethnicity.\nWe introduce the idea of the Slovak Music Database, a comprehensive, mainly opt-in, opt-out database that of Slovak artists and Slovak music that should be supported by the local content regulation and other policies.

In the next year, we would like to create a modern, comprehensive national music database that serves music promotion in radio, streaming, live music within Slovakia and abroad.\nTo train our locally relevant, alternative recommendation system, we filled the Demo Slovak Music Database from two sources. In the opt-in process we asked artists to participate in Listen Local, and we selected those artists who opted in from Slovakia, or whose language is Slovak.

Such a system may work well for an amateur DJ in a home party or a small local radio that just wants to make sure that the music in its programme will be liked by many people. They reinforce existing trends and make already popular songs and their creators even more popular.\nIf the recommendation engine is supported by big data and a machine learning system – or increasingly, a combination of several machine learning algorithms – the general modus operandi is to exploit information about both content and users in order to achieve certain goals.\nHow algorithmic recommendation systems work? How recommendation systems work? Spotify’s recommendation system is a mix of content- and collaborative filtering that exploits information about users’ past behaviour (e.g. liked, skipped, and re-listened songs), the behaviour of similar users, as well as data collected from the users’ social media and other online activities, or from blogs. Deezer uses a similar system that is boosted by the acquisition of Last.fm – big data created from user comments are used to understand the mood of the songs, for example.\nSpotify makes 16 billion music recommendations each month in 2020. YouTube, which plays an even larger role in music discovery, uses a system comprised of two neural networks: one for candidate generation and one for ranking. The candidate generation deep neural network provides works on the basis of collaborative filtering, while the ranking system is based on content-based filtering and a form of utility ranking that takes into consideration the user’s languages, for example.\nWhat makes these systems common is that they maximize the algorithm creators’ corporate key performance indicators. Spotify wants to be ‘your playlist to life’ and increase the amount of music played during work or sports in the background, during travelling, or active music listening –- i.e. maximizing the number of hours spent using it, and do not let empty timeslots for other music providers, such as radio stations. YouTube and Netflix have similar targets. They are in many ways like commercial radio targets, which want to maximize the time spent listening to the broadcast stream. Radios and YouTube, in particular, have similar goals because they are mainly financed through advertising. For Spotify or Netflix, their key financial motivation is to avoid users’ cancelling their subscriptions or changing it to different providers, such as Amzon, Apple or Deezer.\nWhat is the problem with black box recommendation systems? What they also have in common is that they do not aim to give a fair chance to each uploaded song, serve equally every artist, or provide whatever equality of chances for English, Slovak or Farsi language content.\nThey tend to reinforce trends similarly to music charts, but with far bigger efficiency. As the Dutch comedian, author and journalist Arjen Lubach explains the YouTube algorithm, to keep their personal recommendations engaging all the day and all of the night, they create a comfortable universe for the user allows little distraction in. If the user wants to listen to global hit music, or stoner rock, it will never be distracted with anything else.\nZondag met Lubach on Dutch public broadcaster VPRO. Click settings sign to change the language of the captions.\nThe problem with such hyper-personalized media is that they leave no room for public activities. Public broadcasters, which had a monopoly to television broadcasting in most European countries until the early 1990s, for example, were aiming to air a diversity of news, knowledge and access to local culture. Many countries on all continents have maintained local content guidelines for broadcasting on public, commercial and community television and radio channels, for example, local music and films, and reliable news as a public service. Personalized media-, social media- and streaming platforms do not have such obligations.\nBlack box recommendation systems usually maximize a corporate key performance indicator, and they are not subject to usual public new service or local content regulations that traditional broadcast media is.\nThe goal and the steps that the algorithm is pursuing is not know to content creators, and they do not know when will the algorithm work for their benefit or against them.\nTransparent and regulated AI In our view, utility-based recommendation system can provide a bridge between current, corporate-owned systems that maximize a media or streaming platforms’ business indicators.\nPublic new service requirements or local content requirements (“national quotas”) set for commercial broadcasting are similar to utility or …","date":1607958600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607958600,"objectID":"47f57bbd20cd48de6adc243ce9e2328b","permalink":"https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-12-15-alternative-recommendations/","publishdate":"2020-12-14T17:10:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2020-12-15-alternative-recommendations/","section":"post","summary":"Regulating black box, private algorithms and data monopolies is only a first step to damage control.

Where do you have the strongest audience?\nSo Tiny Room Records is actually based in Utrecht and Bilthoven. Utrecht is a city. That’s where the scene happens and that’s what we’re part of. I live in Bilthoven, which is 5 kilometers away from Utrecht. It’s next to the woods. It’s quiet. It’s small. It’s perfect for focusing on creating beautiful music and art. There’s inspiration from the sight and smell of nature and not a lot of distractions like pubs and venues. So as a musician, my home base is Bilthoven. Running a label, it’s Utrecht because all the shows, recordings, and rehearsals happen there. It’s also where we’ve held most of the Tiny Room nights, and our 5th year anniversary festival.\nHow important is touring for your label’s roster? How do artists select touring locations? Where do you think your label’s strongest potential for finding a new audience would be?\nOur rehearsal space and venue Studio Patrick generates a DIY scene which is unique for Utrecht but not necessarily Europe. In the NL, we’ve always had a strong connection with Subblicious in Leiden, Lepel Concerts in Groningen, Roodkapje in Rotterdam, Vondelbunker in Amsterdam, Katzwijm Studio in Voorhout, De Ruimte in Amsterdam, the art scene around Danielle Papenborg in Nijmegen, and the Van Onderen festival. We’re also connected to labels like Subroutine, Moving Furniture, Snowstar, Coaster, Narrowminded, Geertruida and so on.\nWe use these contacts to set up tours and other possibilities long the way. Sometimes it doesn’t work out wen you have a Canadian artist playing for two people in Heerhugowaard, but you don’t know until you try. That’s how I stumbled upon the scene around Honest House, a label and booking agency in Liège, Belgium a couple years ago. It turned out to be perfect for all our bands and we still maintain a good partnership with them in order to regularly produce a few nights of live music. We will start working with them again around live music, of course, when we are post-COVID. Same goes for Lousy Moon Records in Köln. I think there are a lot more places like this and it would be great to have more insight about where the super DIY/indie/arty/folk/postpunk/kraut/experimental songwriting stuff is happening.

Changing genres and forms, creating musical and visual worlds spiced up with BDSM attire they have been playing shows in Slovakia and releasing a full-length album in 2018. Tammy is a bilingual Slovak, who is more comfortable in the English language due to her upbringing than in the country’s language, and against what she feels to be the expectation of the local audience, she sings in English. No wonder that she is also looking for ways to expand their universe beyond the country borders.\nTammy believes that The Youniverse it at a crossroads. To be more successful at home, they would have to switch to their native Slovak language, and to be more successful in English they would have to connect better to foreign audiences. She believes that the local audiences often seek a different quality than what she offers – the purity of her voice instead of auto-tune, or the native language instead of the language of rock and roll. Therefore, their main targets are the Southwestern part of the United States, particularly Los Angeles in California and Austin in Texas, and they believe that their eccentric show would probably create interest in Japan, too.\nWhat do they know or think of big data algorithms? The Youniverse hired a Google Analytics manager and they try to figure out how they could reach out to fans in far away places, or to understand how their songs occasionally find their ways to people in different countries. Tammy knows that Spotify employs playlist curators who are helped with computer-based algorithms to find new music, but she is not familiar with the process – that is why she volunteered to participate in our Listen Local project and our Feasibility Study for the creation of a Slovakian music promotion service.\nListen Local is developing transparent algorithms and open source solutions to find new audiences for independent music.

These captchas are there to prevent robots filling out the forms with funny data, steal your email address or to pretend to be human viewers for paid traffic, because who wants to pay for bots visiting the website?\nThe problem with the captcha business is that until now, Google was the main provider of them, which created an inherent conflict of interests. Google, as the world’s biggest advertising agency, has an interest in letting robots viewing advertisements - something that the “free” captchas are supposed to stop. And Google let’s them do it in a small percent of the cases. Those small percent add up to billions of page views.\nRobots learned to fill in captchas, but Google did not fundamentally change the way they work, instead it released its 3rd version, which collects plenty of personal data about the viewer – an important input again for its advertisment personalization business.\nAnd third, but not least, solving captchas became an industry itself. Human understanding of pictures trains all sorts of AI applications from self-driving cars to medical diagnostics. People who solve billions and billions of captchas for Google actually carry out billions worth work for the advertising giant.\nhCaptcha’s new types of riddles are more difficult to solve for robots. “Competing with Google and other Big Tech companies seems like a tall order: their monopolistic market power, platform effects and army of highly paid developers are generally considered too powerful to tackle for anyone but other tech giants such as Facebook or Amazon. Our story shows that it doesn’t have to be that way - you can beat Big Tech by focussing on privacy.”\nEli-Shaoul Khedouri and Todd Anderson at Intuition Machines built up hCaptha, with an h for humans in three years to rival Google. They created an ethical AI alternative that currently has a 15% global market share in cybersecurity services focusing on privacy and re-inventing a business model, when they are actually paying for large webmasters to host their riddles.\nIf you embed their hCaptcha to your website, you will be offered either a cash-out after the recognition work your readers to for them, or you can opt to have the value of this work transferred to a charity – currently to Wikimedia Foundation. As they write in their blogpost AI Ethics Policy,\n… virtually every technology, from pencils to dynamite, is a dual use solution; it can be used for good or ill. Every company researching, building, or selling dual use solutions has an obligation to consider the consequences of their actions.\nOur data observatories and our Listen Local solutions have a similar aim: reduce inequality and unfair advantage from big data exploitation by joining many small data sources in our observatories, and creating recommendation systems and analytics solutions that empower local players to compete with Big Tech in their home markets.

In 2020 she released her fourth album Celibát with the main themes of loneliness and self-appreciation. Album was created in collaboration with the producer Jonatán Pastirčák.\nKatarzia started her career as a folk singer. In the past years she moved on towards electronic music. She describes her current sound can as a mix of folk and electropop. The tour to promote her newest album Celibát had been planned for spring 2020, unfortunately due to the Covid-19 pandemic had to be postponed indefinitely. As many other artists, Katarzia thinks that the current situation is not easy.\nAt the moment, I am not working on any new projects. I am looking for a new job. Once the pandemic is over, I would like to stay where I am now, and return to the clubs to play for my audience. As I sing in Slovak, I know where my place is – I don’t want to perform abroad, of course, unless I turn to techno music. On a more personal level, I would like to live in New York – not as a musician, tough.\nKatarzia is originally from Nitra, Slovakia and she has been living in Prague for a couple of years.\nI live in Dejvice – there is a nice clubroom there, but I don’t visit that much. I enjoy going to National Theatre, Dejvice Theatre, Meetfactory, Archa Theatre and Rudolfinum. All the old classics.\nDespite the restrictions during the pandemic, Katarzia managed to shoot a video for her song Hoří i voda from Celibát.\nThe music video is a short film, directed by Jay Walker, an American who lives and works in Prague.

People usually discover new music in their young age as they are forming their own personal identity with their peer group. This process mainly happens in the school, where similarly aged, educated young people spend much of their day together.\nThe music discovery phase is strongly related to the time when most people get their music education: their skills to listen to music, play music or sing, and to compose new music. Investment into music education pays of in later age: people with more diverse music education, for example, with the ability to play music, tend to visit concerts more or discover more music in later life stages.\nThe annual growth (top chart) and total growth (lower chart) of the 15-24 years-old population in select European countries. For practical reasons and supported by academic research, we chose the age group 15-24 as the key age group for music discovery. We placed the national population of the music discovery age group in the Music \u0026amp; Society pillar of the Demo Music Observatory.\nThe changes across Europe are dramatic: in Latvia and the Baltic states, the music discovery age population decreased by 60% since the countries (re-)gained independence in 1991. Musicians and their organizations must work hard in these countries on developing export strategies if they want to maintain the market and audience of their music.\nSome European countries, for example, the Netherlands and Turkey have significantly increased their future audiences. In Turkey this is mainly related to population growth, in the Netherlands to immigration. Countries with a growing young population have a strong position for their music business.\nNot all lost in the Baltics and other countries where the music discovery age population is shrinking. Much of the lost young population migrated to the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe. If artists and their association in these countries find a way to connect with these new diaspora, their market loss will be far less dramatic. Connecting to the diaspora is the most natural way to start exporting new music.\nGet the data from the Demo Music Observatory.

Craft beer bars are highly recommended, but the city has pretty great pubs in general. Walking alongside the river on the Buda side offers a great panorama to the city, which includes the best looking parliament building of Europe. For daytime activities, getting on a bike and going to less busy parts, like the Danube banks Római-part and Kopaszi-gát are nice, or maybe do some downtown record store shopping. For the night time, cruising around the 6th, 7th, and 8th districts will result in good fun.\nWhere are you heading to? To Romania, particularly in the direction of Oradea, Cluj Napoca, Timișoara, because there are lots of people interested in checking out their Hungarian friends from the other side of the border and because their mountains are lovely. Bratislava and any towns with a relevant Hungarian-speaking population in Slovakia, for the same reason mentioned before, and because their mountains are also nice.

We created a testing database with their music and other artists from their cities, regions and countries. We need new recommendation engines to dig out from a pile of international hits the local artists.\nAvoid landing on Forgetify, in the universe of never listened-to-songs. Understand how artists and their songs can find audience in the region relevant to their career goals, tour destinations, export opportunities. Our preliminary analysis is not representative for nationality, though we believe that we will find serious regional, linguistic and national patterns. We are using examples from Spotify. To be fair to Spotify, while their algorithm has many problems, their API is at least very open, as opposed to Apple Music where we do not really know what is going on.\nOur main concern is that some artists and their songs seem to be never recommended. Moreover, if artists and songs from a city, region or country are rarely or never recommended, then they risk losing their home market: the local audience will be recommended music that is coming outside of the city, region or country.\nArtist has more related artists as number popularity and number of followers grows. Nationality may affect related artists. One of the most important way recommendations work is via related artists. If an artist has no related artists, it is very unlikely that either via user browsing interaction or via the algorithm that artists or her songs will be discovered by anybody.\nIf you want your music and audience to be analysed in Listen Local, fill out this form. We will include you in our demo application and our analysis to be revealed in December.\nBecause big data algorithms learn from user behaviour, more popular, more often selected songs, and songs selected by more users are more likely to be recommended.\nThe algorithm can learn more about popular music, because the song is more often selected by a larger number of people If the algorithm finds more related music, it means that it “learned” the repertoire of the artist. Artists with very little popularity tend to be related to 20-30 artists, but at a popularity level of 40-60 they are related to 30-40 artists. Seems simple, right?\nNot that much. If you want the algorithm to learn your music well, you really have to go “viral”.\nArtist with less than 1000 followers risk not being to recommended at all. Doubling your chances to be discovered requires 1000x more followers. Doubling your routes to being recommended via other artists’ music requires exponential growth. You need to have 1000x more followers to double the routes leading to your artist profile and recordings.\nAs we have shown, the current recommendation engines are re-enforcing the existing status quo, and they can re-enforce the marginal status of subcultures, artists from a nation, city or region. In other words, as we often say, big data creates injustice.\nWith our Music Observatory for larger organizations and with our Listen Local analytics and recommendations for artists, managers and labels, we want to fight exactly this injustice.

We created a Demo Music Observatory to provide a practical guidance on the decisions facing the European stakeholders, and to answer the questions that were left open in the Feasibility Study — particularly on data integration and the institutional model, where a wrong choice can lead to very long delivery time, quality control and budgeting.\nWe have been developing our Demo Music Observatory in the world’s 2nd ranked university-backed incubator program, the Yes!Delft AI Validation Lab since 15 September 2020. Our aim is to show a better organizational model, examples of research automation and other data integration innovation that can reduce the budgetary needs of the European Music Observatory by 80-90% and provide far more timely, accurate, and relevant service than most data observatories in Europe.\nCEEMID has been creating a similar data observatory to the foreseen European Data Observatory, solely based on the contribution of about 60 European stakeholders. As the Feasibility Study suggests, we would be happy to transfer much of CEEMID’s content to the European Data Observatory, which could potentially fill up about 50-70% of the envisioned observatory. We are building our Demo Music Observatory based on the 2000 pan-European indicators collected by CEEMID since 2014.\nChallenge Our Demo Observatory: Check out the Music Diversity \u0026amp; Circulation Pillar of our Demo Music Observatory.

The Feasibility Study is based on perceived data gaps between data needs of the European stakeholders and data availability. We have shown earlier this year to the European stakeholders that much of these data gaps are illusory. We would like to give about 50 indicators with full documentation, automated, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annual refreshment for free for all music industry users.

While the granularity of our data is a bit too low for active participation like playing a music instrument or singing, we see striking differences for Wales, too.\nParticipation in music: playing an instrument While Wales is part of the UK British Industry, its role is similar to Slovak or the Croatian music industry in many sense. It is part of a larger entity (Slovakia was part of Czechoslovakia, Croatia part of Yugoslavia, and now they are part of the borderless EU) but in an economically peripheral way. Wales offers less career opportunities for artists and audience, so the most valuable, highly-educated, high-earning audience (which can keep buying more and more expensive tickets) is missing, any many art talents leave to England or beyond.\nParticipation in music: singing This leaves the “supply” of music drying, and the sustainability of the live music audience at peril.\nIn July 2020, Professor Paul Carr of University of South Wales was commissioned by Senedd Cymru – the Welsh Parliament to create a report examining the state of play in the post Covid-19 music industries in Wales.

However, there are very few labels and artists who actually feel that they are profiting from this conversion.\nIn our Central European Music Industry Report we have shown the paradox of streaming growth: while the streaming market appears to be growing, for the individual rightsholder, artists, or label, neither the volumes nor the revenues show much of a growth. There are many factors contributing to the fact that for the ‘typical’ artist streaming does not bring revenue growth, and one of them is the increasing competition with the major label released music, particularly from the United States.\nFor a long time, the user base of Spotify and similar services did not expand at the same rate as the available repertoire, so more and more songs were competing for not so many users, many of them ending up on the never played Forgetify list. In other words, competition has been steadily growing.\nIn Europe, almost everybody would like to get to the U.S. (getting harder and harder) or the UK (getting somewhat more accessible). Some have a strong market background at home, others lost their home market without gaining foreign markets.\nSome smaller markets are somewhat protected from the competition often have low revenues because of the lower subscription fee and slower roll-out of the services. In the first years of the introduction of these services, like in Croatia or Russia this year, it is critically important to use this period to gain experience with holding or increasing local market shares.\nThe local music industry must find ways to train algorithms, promote local music contain that is relevant for the new audiences who use streaming platforms. Our Listen Local Initiative aims build new data integrations that can help training data that reverses this trend.\nOur Music Observatory project is aiming to track all indicators that jointly determine streaming success: subscription fees, exchange rates, subscription numbers, use hours, levels of competition, typical playing volumes, typical stream prices, and likelihood of crossing borders to export markets.\nOur aim with the Demo Music Observatory is to find a validated business model to bring to light the roughly 2000 indicators collected by our CEEMID project for music pricing, AI, licensing, monitoring, grant evaluation, export market targeting and similar uses. We would like to transfer these data assets to a future European Music Observatory. We are giving away in these weeks about 50 automatically maintained, well documented, high-quality indicators with history and timely new data publications for potential users and founding partners of the European Music Observatory.\nWe placed the following dataset in our observatory, to be refreshed weekly:\nYou can download the entire dataset in different formats here in the Music Diversity \u0026amp; Circulation pillar (see all pillars) of our Demo Music Observatory.\nWe share the view that big data creates injustice. Organizations that control large amounts of data, for example, the entire listening history of hundreds of millions of people in all major countries of the world, can train algorithms and robots that drive most of the music sales in the world. They can make your investment into a sound recording successful or doomed. They can circumvent or help a local content regulation, reinforce, or disable a national cultural policy goal. We want big data to work for small venues, independent labels, startups, great and undiscovered artists. We believe that you cannot make a successful album launch, a market entry or introduce a successful cultural policy without large amounts of well processed and correctly analysed data. We want to create a Music Observatory that integrates the small data of many small bands, small labels, small venues, small countries, and mount correct the injustice.

We often find that big data works against such types of users, and our Listen Local Initiative was designed to change this trend.\nBig data algorithms will increase injustice and breach social norms if they are trained on biased data, or if the algorithms themselves are biased — this is why we place so much emphasis on algorithm transparency and input data transparency. Facebook, Apple, and Spotify are often criticized for helping the spread of hate, for example. But how can an algorithm turn racist?\nDaniel Kraemer \u0026amp; Steve Holden reported on BBC recently that Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer and YouTube found recently hosting racist music – and they removed it after the BBC’s investigation.\nOn Spotify, public playlists and “suggested artist” algorithms make it easier to find extreme content. In some cases, users created playlists that collated songs and bands associated with the National Socialist Black Metal (NSBM) movement, mainly from Eastern Europe and Russia. Anti-Semitism and glorification of the Holocaust is common in their lyrics.\nHow can an algorithm become racist?\nIf an algorithm is trained on the tastes and habits of white users, it will less likely recommend Black music (i.e. genres with histories in Black communities such as hip-hop or jazz, or Black artists making any genre of music) to anyone.\nIf music is coming from a Black community (based on genre, location, or artists with a Black identity), a racist algorithm will be less likely to recommend it to white users, according to what the algorithm predicts white users typically listen to and like.\nIf the algorithm learns that certain users have listened to and liked music with racist content, it will provide them with more racist material.\nOf course, you can replace black and white with any minority and majority group. Take Slovak and American; major release and independent release. European independent music makers may feel a minority compared to international majors. The problem with algorithms is that they can ruthlessly reinforce injustice, because they are focused on learning how to do things better, faster, and more — but not in qualitatively different ways — than they were done before.\nWhat can we do?\nFight for the removal of inappropriate content from the training set. If you see any non-English hateful songs on these platforms, let us know, because English-language moderation is just the tip of the iceberg. Make sure that the training sets of the algorithms behind sales or listening recommendations are inclusive. Our Listen Local Initative is an early beta of a recommendation system that makes sure that locally relevant music gets recommended to locally relevant audiences, and does not need to engage in a David and Goliath fight against international giants. Allow the external verification of the algorithm and its results. We allow multiple levels of audit for all our algorithms, and we make all critical elements of our data products open source.

Originally from Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, he finished last year putting their former band’s songs into a 40-minute feature film Delta wave (2019) with English subtitles and started to look for a new music film challenge. Propeler, with one Bosnian ‘l’, had to move on with a new drummer, and Duka wanted to find himself a new music project in his new town, Cologne, Germany.\nHe is now making a series of songs, where he is the author of all music and lyrics, but he is inviting recording artists from all over the word to make recorded audio and video performances. He gives much freedom to the performing artists to interpret his songs the way they like, and he dreams that one day, when the pandemia is gone, he will be able to perform the entire set live. These songs are released on all platforms that Distroid covers under the name Duka Base (see for example Spotify here)\nDuka Base - Watch Me (feat. Amina Kamran)\nDuka was initially struggling with the same problem as we do in Data \u0026amp; Lyrics when we try to explain our Listen Local or Music Observatory projects. “It was hard at the beginning to convince artists to take a part in the show, because it was hard to describe the whole idea. After the first show, everything went better, because the artist could see exactly what I wanted from them. Now, the response is way better of course.”\nAnd then it started to go smoothly. “All those artists have had their own home studios, and it went quick and well. But it’s a bit harder to record the video, because all the artists with whom I worked are musicians, and not filmmakers. All in all, I am very happy with the willingness of the artists to do it as best they can, and at the end, I am happy with the outcome. It’s interesting for me how I talked with everyone the same way I would talk with someone in Cologne. The core of producing something is the same, or at least very similar no matter where you live.”\n#3 DMM Podcast Show / PAKISTAN / Amina Kamran / “Watch Me”\nIn spite of the global ambition, Duka does not make a living from creating music. He has a dayjob as a motion designer at Denkwerk, which is not connected to his musician career. He just moved to Cologne in 2018, so he is not yet integrated in the scene of the German town while he continues to follow the Sarajevo scene as much he can — though, of course, his musician friends are as much stranded as anybody else in Europe in 2020.\nOther artists Robin Kestner Katarzia Duka Base Twentees Willemijn de Krey Youniverse Marie de la Montagne And a label:\nTiny Rooms ","date":1603865400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603865400,"objectID":"b9d06394143c807a9081f0ed20c1a8b0","permalink":"https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-28-duka-mission/","publishdate":"2020-10-28T08:10:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2020-10-28-duka-mission/","section":"post","summary":"It was hard at the beginning to convince artists to take a part in the show, because it was hard to describe the whole idea.

That led to an uneasy series of conversations with the consultants of this project, and a very enlightening series of conversations with European civil servants, music industry organizations, music managers and artists. My main pitch was that every single assumption of this project is wrong.\nThey started from the assumption that there is hardly any data available on the European music scene – whereas we found while building up CEEMID, errr, a pan-European music data observatory, is that music is one of the most data-driven industries in the world, it is choking in numbers, and the reason why this data is not visible is very different. They were talking about lack of data in fields where we already had about 2000 pan-European indicators ready. (See Introducing the CEEMID Observatory, 9/28/2019 large self-contained html file, takes time to load into browser)\nBig data creates injustice The music industry is scattered: it has the author’s or publishing side, the recording side, a large live music business and usually a very environment for classical (art) music. Within these segments there are hundreds of organizations in each EU country, and each have their own small or large datasets. The music industry has plenty of data, but it is not integrated, and it is often hidden from organizations that may have a conflicting agenda.\nFragmentation: Three income streams in Croatia The fragmentation of data makes these players easy prey in the era of big data. Companies who monopolise big datasets first and create weapons of math destruction in the forms of algorithms that work for them, can take an unusually large share of the money created throughout the value chain. Proprietary, uncontrolled, big data trained algorithms reinforce inequality — this makes Google’s YouTube, Spotify, but also Netflix in films or Amazon in books so powerful against its competitors, but also against competition regulators or suppliers — in this case songwriters, video producers, filmmakers, book publishers and authors. If their algorithm works against a creator, the creator is doomed, because half of the global sales are driven by secret algorithms.\nBig Data vs Small Datasets, Research Automation The problem of the music industry is not too little, but too much data. Music is drowning in numbers, and it has too little resources to turn much data into valuable information.\nOur concept of the European Music Observatory is to pool enough resources to create value for rightsholders, talent managers, venues, festivals and the entire music ecosystem. Most music organization employ 1-5 people, and even the largest national organization, like collective management organizations, fall under the EU definition of small- and medium sized enterprises. They do not have data scientists, market researchers, forecasters. They are small organizations with small research budgets and very little time for researching. Nevertheless, with more than 60 partners in 12 countries we have shown that this is possible:\nwe turned 700 million royalty statements into meaningful indicators about the price and volume growth in 20 European streaming markets;\ncalculated the value gap and the value of private copying in Hungary and Croatia;\nhelped closing the royalty gap in Hungary and Slovakia by helping collective management to significantly increase their royalty collection;\nhelped granting agencies to make more relevant grant calls and designed indicators to measure the impact of their grants;\nstarted the creation of local recommendation engines that help the circulation of the small nation repertoires or city scenes in Europe or beyond.\nMusic Has Data, But You Need A Map Scattered industries tend to be riddled with conflicts of interests. While working with royalty collection management societies in the last 7 years I often saw that songwriters, producers and performers are often fighting each other for slices of the pie that is just too small. That means that national members of CISAC (GESAC in Europe), IFPI, and AEPO-ARTIS often do not share data with each other, although their income is below any legally acceptable threshold. They have individually very rich datasets that in many jurisdictions just never meet. Labels, small publishers are so little organizations that they do not have a data scientist, let alone a dedicated IT person, or even an HR professional to hire the services of data scientists.\nWe were able to collect at least 70% of the information content of the planned European Music Observatory, and far more, than most of the 50 data observatories we examined in Europe, because we took an approach inspired in open source software development: continuous opt-in, opt-out data integration, focusing on the synergies that partners can achieve, instead of aiming at endless discussions and compromises on sharing data.

For me, Forgetify has always been a puzzling and wonderful application, because it shows purely where your artists do not want to end up.\nForgetify is a wonderful application that is “recommending” you songs that have never been played on Spotify. Music from artists that has not been played by their fans, their friends or foes, brothers and sisters, children and grandchildren! I use recommendations in quotation marks, because their recommendations are usually based on your taste. Forgetify just picks you a song that has not been played on Spotify ever.

All I did is that I took their “recommendation” and put it on a list, then hit next. I skipped tracks that were not licensed to the Netherlands, or which were not music tracks but spoken words, for example sound recordings of stand-up comedies. Then I put these tracks on three lists\nsomething that I felt was appropriate called classical music another that is popular music and another which is a mix of historical recordings, and other music which I think has such a special audience that it would not make a good mix with the other two. For example, the Eightsome Reel Pt 1 by the Bob Smith’s Ideal Band is a digitalized re-release of the LP re-release of 78’’ records from the 1930s, and it is obviosuly no competitor for a modern classical or pop music track. Even the labels popular music or classical music would call for further explanation, but we’ll get there another time.\nSo, let’s see what we have after removing historical, traditional folk, spoken word and classical music tracks in the supposedly popular music “recommendations”:\nSimilarly to the use of the the word “recommendations”, the expression of “popular music” is a bit ironic here, because we are talking about music that is anything but popular, at least not on Spotify.\nFirst let’s make a very short comparison of the current global hits, a subjective list that I created for this month and started to use for explaining our recommendations, my Forgetify Pop October 2020 list. I will follow these songs in the coming years, and will keep adding new forgotten songs to my list. Then I’ll reflect on why these songs are forgotten.\nA Quick Comparison The next comparison uses some musicology and sound engineering “features” of the songs on the three lists. These characteristics are themselves recognized by algorithms, and they are used for Spotify’s own recommendations.\nIf anything is clear from these boxplots is that there is nothing clear about forgotten songs. The boxplot’s box show the typical values of popularity or other features, and the line starting from the box still relatively frequent values. The long boxes of the Forgetify Pop list show that there are all sorts of music on Forgetify: screechy and not, danceable and not, cheerful and sad. My subjective list is shorter and more pronounced: it contains songs that I found to be a good match to listen together. The current global hits are less similar than my personal selection, but far more homogeneous than all those millions of songs that end up in the forgotten long tail of the catalogue.\nOf course, the only thing that connects this playlist is that the songs are not classical or world/folk music, and that they are forgotten. The This Time single from 2009 by the Intonated (3 listeners this month, including myself) is heavy guitar music. It is dark. Perdido from the Candido Featuring Al Cohn album released in 1956 by the Cándido Camero (6945 monthly listeners) is a cheerful jazz song. It is likely that this song actually has an audience, but not on Spotify. Cándido was born as Candido de Guerra Camero in 1921 in Havana, and with his 99 years he is one of the oldest living artists on Spotify. He recorded this album almost 40 years before the internet was opened for the public. For his life long achievement in Afro-Cuban jazz he received the National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters Award in 2008.\nMy personal favorite from the Forgetify Pop list is Groovy \u0026amp; Linda from the Neon Princess album released in 1968 by Tom Parrott (39 monthly listeners). It is a nice hippy song with the favorite effect of ‘68, the inclusion of a sitar. The song is not very good, the sitar and the guitar make a rather chaotic mix, but Tom Parrott (born in …","date":1603555200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603555200,"objectID":"a884c8f5c3974d14a076724ba722cfe5","permalink":"https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-24-forgetify_pop_october/","publishdate":"2020-10-24T18:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2020-10-24-forgetify_pop_october/","section":"post","summary":"Forgetify is an application that is “recommending” you songs that have never been played on Spotify - not even by their families, friends or foes.

If you are all small, even local content guidelines, such as national radio quotas or public radio targets will not help you, because you remain invisible.\nWith the support of the Slovak Arts Council, SOZA, non-profit civic association representing more than 2,600 rights holders in Slovakia and over 1 million abroad (musical works composers, lyrics and publishers), and Consolidated Independent, a music distributor platform Reprex is preparing a feasibility study for the collaborative, transparent research tool and application that helps you to find your way to radio playlists, connect to fans in your own city, country, and in other towns along viable tour routes. Make music export more of a science than a guessing game.\nIn the first step, until the end of 2020, we are going to create a demo application and a feasibility study with quantitative musicologists and data scientists. The demo application will show how to use AI to place the music of the volunteering bands and labels’s repertoire on radio lists and personal playlists. Our feasibility study will show how different local content guidelines (radio quotas, public broadcaster targets, and other tools) can affect the market share of small local and national repertoires, and will provide culture policymakers and competition authorities with insight how to make the algorithm-driven music streaming, broadcasting marketplace more even.\nHow can you participate in the experiment? In the first phase of the experiment, only artists and their groups released on Spotify can participate.\nParticipation in the experiment is free. The research findings, including potential targets for your music, will be fully open, transparent and free.\nIf you are an artist, you can simply fill in a form identifying your music on Spotify, filling in a few biographical data about yourself (or your band, ensemble, group). We do not ask any financial data, and only very limited personal information. We only ask about city affiliations, targeted cities, age, experience level, and language of your lyrics, if you do not play instrumental music. In our experience, these factors are very important among musicology and sound engineering quality measures.

Participation is open anywhere in the world, but we are focusing on a viable post-covid tour route around Budapest – Bratislava – Vienna – Salzburg – Munich – Ruhr – the Netherlands – Belgium. We hope to give guidance on targeting both recorded and live music.\nIf you represent several artists as a talent manager, music publisher, record label, granting agency or music export office, please get in touch with us for onboarding. We will ask you to contribute a small sum on a crowdsourcing basis to expand our experimental project, but the small financial contribution is not a mandatory requirement.

The songs I chose are subjectively important to me, a bit maybe even controversial ones, and probably very different from the music that you are listening to.\nI would like to use this example as a start of series how we are thinking about connecting musicians and their fans in new ways with the help of AI and big data. How we are planning to bring back life to the small venues after the pandemic? How we try to keep the link between musicians and their audience alive in this very sad year?\nIn this chart you can see a short analysis of my Wounded Egos playlist. It is a very personal, subjective playlist. Subjectivity is very important to us, because we want to use the insights from big data and machine learning in a very personal way to the music community: fans, artists, technicians, managers, labels, publisher and all the ecosystem.

This time I would like to illustrate the difference of my listening habits from the global mainstream, and I won’t go in depth to how we want to make more relevant recommendations. These are the difference that we are trying to capture for local music scenes, cities, countries in our Listen Local initiative.\nIf you find it interesting why I chose these songs in October 2020, you read about my choices as a personal recommendation at the end of the post.\nA Quick Comparison My playlist is a very subjective and curated playlist… (I curated it myself, after all!) These songs are very different from the songs that people are more likely listening to around me in the Netherlands, or all over the world.\nMy subjective list for October 2020: 1. Wounded Egos - 2. Sirens - 3. Don’t Panic - 4. Can’t Stop - 5. Michael And Heather At The Baggage Claim - 6. Machinist - 7. Royal Screw Up - 8. Kyoto - 9.

Chance The Rapper)\nThe most streamed songs in the Netherlands overlap with the most streamed songs all over the world, but there is no overlap with my list.\nOur aim is to create locally relevant recommendations. If you live in Antwerpen, and you are looking for bands that you can see on a small stage after the pandemic, we will recommend you great music from Northwestern Belgium and the South of Holland. If you want to visit San Diego after the pandemic, we’ll recommend you music from the San Diego scene.

These characteristics are themselves recognized by algorithms, and they are used for Spotify’s own recommendations.\nMy songs are independent songs, far less popular than the global hits. My playlist is mainly indie rock, so far less danceable, less loud than the current hits, but it is more energetic! The average tempo is similar to the hits, but I tend to chose slower songs, too.\nSpotify’s valence is a quantitative measure that aims to capture the positiveness conveyed by the a sound recording(e.g.happy, cheerful, euphoric on the positive side, and sad, depressed, angry on the negative side). Another striking difference among my list and the two hitlists is the far broader scale of emotions conveyed by the songs that I selected for October 2020.\nIn the next blogposts we will explain some details.\nWounded Egos: Daniel’s October Playlist 1.

Not only great artists, composers, technicians, managers fell victim to the virus, but musicians lost about 50–90% of their income from live music. This translates to a 100% loss for the live music technicians and managers.\nSee our earlier blogpost on what you see on the video.\nThe music industry was never a place for great job security.

Our open source, open data, open collaboration approach allows to connect various open and proprietary data sources, and our reproducible research workflows allow us to automate data collection, processing, publication, documentation and presentation.\nOur scripts are checking data sources, such as Eurostat’s Eurobase, Spotify’s API and other music industry sources every day for new information, and process any data corrections or new disclosure, interpolate, backcast or forecast missing values, make currency translations and unit conversions.

Our aim is to show a better organizational model, examples of research automation and other data integration innovation that can reduce the budgetary needs of the European Music Observatory by 80-90% and provide far more timely, accurate, and relevant service than most data observatories in Europe.\nBackground Data gaps Organization and institutional model Quality Control Value For Money, Budget Use Cases Background Data is power, and big data creates injustice. Organizations that control large amounts of data, for example, the entire listening history of hundreds of millions of people in all major countries of the world, can train algorithms and robots that drive most of the music in the world. They can make your investment into a sound recording successful or doomed. They can circumvent or help a local content regulation, reinforce, or disable a national cultural policy goal. A country may introduce national artist quotas on radio, if all the youth will be personally recommended foreign songs in their music discovery age in the very same country.\nWe believe that answer of the EU and UNESCO with the creation of permanent data collection points, so-called data observatories is correct. However, after reviewing 62 data observatories, we are convinced that many data observatories are doomed to fail.\nOur private observatory, CEEMID was consulted in the creation of the Feasibility study for the establishment of a European Music Observatory, and some of our recommendations found way into the consultant’s document. We created a Demo Music Observatory to provide a practical guidance on the decisions facing the European stakeholders, and to answer the questions that were left open in the Feasibility Study — particularly on data integration and the institutional model, where a wrong choice can lead to very long delivery time, quality control and budgeting.\nData Gaps According to the feasibility study, 11% of the stakeholders consulted found that sufficient data was available for their work, 30% said that there could be more data but that does not affect their work, and 59% found that the lack of data affects their work.\nWe have shown in the Central \u0026amp; Eastern European Music Industry Report 2020, featured in the CCS Ecosystems: FLIPPING THE ODDS Conference – a two-day high-level stakeholder event jointly organized by Geothe-Institute and the DG Education and Culture of the European Commission with the Creative FLIP project.that much of the data gap is illusory: the fragmented nature of the music industry, the lack of in-house data expertise create bottlenecks in the use of the data. However, the data is present, and as it is stated in 148-149, we are willing to transfer thousands of indicators in all pillars to the future European Music Observatory.\nOur Demo Music Observatory is based on the accepted music industry concept in the US and the EU (the three-income stream model) and its data maps that we could apply to emerging markets – for example, in the case of Croatia. A clear map of the industry and a clear map of the data reveals that much of the perceived gap is illusory. We would like to challenge the European music stakeholders to test us, request seemingly missing data that we will try to publish.\nIllustration: our map to find to locate data in the Croatian music industry. Our Demo Music Observatory is based on the accepted music industry concept in the US and the EU (the three-income stream model) and its data maps. This remains a problem with the Summary of Data Gaps on pages 128-131 that enumerate the perceived lack of data for the three pillars. We believe that these data gaps are in most cases illusory, and the remedies offered in the study are often misplaced.\nCirculation of Repertoire \u0026amp; Cultural Diversity Streaming activity: the Feasibility Study offers Nielsen’s Global Charts as a potential solution, even though we have shown that this is not the right approach.\nThe problem with Nielsen’s charts, or any chart provider’s chart, is that it covers less than 0.01% of the European repertoire, and it depicts a completely irrelevant picture for the 99.99% of the European stakeholders.\nIllustration: our map to find to locate data in the Croatian music industry. Our Demo Music Observatory is based on the accepted music industry concept in the US and the EU (the three-income stream model) and its data maps.

Ex-post data harmonization enables better use of existing data and creates new research opportunities. For example, harmonizing data from different countries enables cross-national comparisons, while merging data from different time points makes it possible to track changes over time.\nRetrospective data harmonization is associated with challenges including conceptual issues with establishing equivalence and comparability, practical complications of having to standardize the naming and coding of variables, technical difficulties with merging data stored in different formats, and the need to document a large number of data transformations. The retroharmonize package assists with the latter three components, freeing up the capacity of researchers to focus on the first.\nSpecifically, the retroharmonize package proposes a reproducible workflow, including a new class for storing data together with the harmonized and original metadata, as well as functions for importing data from different formats, harmonizing data and metadata, documenting the harmonization process, and converting between data types. See here for an overview of the functionalities.\nThe new labelled_spss_survey() class is an extension of haven’s labelled_spss class. It not only preserves variable and value labels and the user-defined missing range, but also gives an identifier, for example, the filename or the wave number, to the vector. Additionally, it enables the preservation – as metadata attributes – of the original variable names, labels, and value codes and labels, from the source data, in addition to the harmonized variable names, labels, and value codes and labels. This way, the harmonized data also contain the pre-harmonization record. The stored original metadata can be used for validation and documentation purposes.\nThe vignette Working With The labelled_spss_survey Class provides more information about the labelled_spss_survey() class.\nIn Harmonize Value Labels we discuss the characteristics of the labelled_spss_survey() class and demonstrates the problems that using this class solves.\nWe also provide three extensive case studies illustrating how the retroharmonize package can be used for ex-post harmonization of data from cross-national surveys:\nAfrobarometer Arab Barometer Eurobarometer The creators of retroharmonize are not affiliated with either Afrobarometer, Arab Barometer, Eurobarometer, or the organizations that designs, produces or archives their surveys.\nWe started building an experimental APIs data is running retroharmonize regularly and improving known statistical data sources.

This allows the creation of many new statistical indicators for the CEEMID Music Observatory and for many market and policy research tasks.\nThis example dataset (Antal 2020) was created from the microdata of the Eurobarometer 79.2 survey using the development version of the eurobarometer R package. The dataset can be downloaded from Zenodo. It will be used in a forthcoming academic publication about book piracy.\nCultural Access \u0026amp; Participation Variables The read a book variable is a weighted sum of the responses that chose from QB1 How many times in the last twelve months have you read a book? any answer apart from “not in the last 12 months.”\nLibrary Access The library access variable is a weighted sum of the responses that chose from QB1 How many times in the last twelve months have you visited a public library? any answer apart from “not in the last 12 months.”\nLimited Library Access The limited library access is a weighted sum of the responses that chose from the question block QB2 And for each of the following activities, please tell me why you haven’t done it or haven’t done it more often in the last 12 months? ... Visited a public library the answer option Limited or poor quality of this activity in the place where you live. In this case, the number of respondents is rather low and this is not a very reliable statistic on regional level.\nScience \u0026amp; Technology Attitudes The supports open access variable is a weighted sum of yes answer options to the QD 17 Do you think that the results of publicly funded research should be made available online free of charge? question.\nDemography The internet access question is a weighted sum of responses to the answer option for D46 Which of the following do you have? - An Internet connection at home.\nThe internet access question is a weighted sum of responses to the answer option for D15 What is your current occupation? - student.\nData Source \u0026amp; Data Processing The source of the data is the microdata file stored in GESIS for the Eurobarometer 79.2 survey.\nThis data file contains the microdata for the Eurobarometer 79.2 survey (TNS Opinion \u0026amp; Social 2013), which includes a Cultural Access and Participation Survey (see (Haan and Broek 2012; Bína, Vladimir et al.2012)) and a Science \u0026amp; Technology Attitude survey.\nThe survey samples are designed to represent the national population, with the exceptions of Northern Ireland, the former East- and West-Germany, and the Turkish community on Cyprus. These samples are designed to be representative for these populations, too.\nFor weighting we used the w1 weights, which allow for post-stratification based on gender, education level and community size.\nIn the case of the Republic of Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Luxembourg and Malta regionalization is not necessary because the entire countries are equivalent to a single NUTS2 region in terms of size and homogeneity. In these countries the weighting produces representative statistics.\nUnfortunately, due to a problem with the original data file, no regional information is available for the Republic of Ireland.\nIn the case of Germany, Great Britain and Italy, data can be summarized on the level of NUTS1 territories, and we are imputing these values into the constituent (smaller sub-)regions on NUTS2 levels. In the case of the remaining countries it can be summarized on NUTS2 levels.\nBecause the survey samples are designed to be nationally representative, the regional sub-samples are not necessarily representative, and often they are very small. For post stratification purposes, we created a “dirty weighting”, Using the national w1 post-stratification weights, but centered to an average value of 1 for each region.\nWe believe that this causes problems on more detailed answer options (on the level levels of the questionnaire’s question hierarchy.) Except for the science attitudes and the library quality questions, we used relatively simple questions that are less affected by the small, potentially biased sample size\nA better option would be the creation of new, regional post-stratification weights. We believe that this would be a very interesting, but very big research task that would potentially need the cooperation of the survey’s producer, Kantar.\nUpdate: This was originally posted on Daniel’s blog. eurobarometer became a much more useful and ex post survey harmonization tool after Marta joined the development efforts\nCitation Daniel, Antal. 2020. “Regionalized Cultural Access and Participation (Books And Libraries) And Science Attitudes Variables 2013.” Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3759811.\nBína, Vladimir, Chantepie, Philippe, Deboin, Valérie, Kommel, Kutt, Kotynek, Josef, and Robin, Philippe. 2012. “ESSnet-CULTURE, European Statistical System Network on Culture.

Countries have different testing and hospitalization protocols, death certificating standards, and there are less and more trustworthy governments. We do not really know the severity of the local epidemics and the relative success of public health policies.\nNevertheless, we have some timely information on how people and the economy react to the epidemic, because there are ongoing, frequent, and comparable data sources on various consequences of the epidemic. A particularly interesting big data source is Google’s geolocational reporting on how people’s time spent in homes, workplaces, parks, shopping areas and recreational areas change. Google gets plenty of realtime data from hundreds of millions of people and compares them by days in the week and local time with the ‘baseline’ scenario before the outbreak of the coronavirus.\nBased on the locational data of various smartphones and application data, we know that people spend 10-15% more time at home since January, and 40-50% less in their workplaces. Similar data is available for other locations.\nWhile people are spending less time in the workplace and more at home in every European country, there are significant differences. Countries in the top left corner, most notable Sweden, switched less from workplaces to homes. On the bottom right corner, Spain and Italy, which were most hit by the epidemic, are in the most severe form of lockdown.\nThere are some outliers, like Romania, where people stay a lot more at home, but not so much less in the workplaces – probably they cannot afford to stay clear of the job, but they are reducing other activities. Or, in the case of Germany, people spend a lot more time in parks.\nI grouped the countries according to their dynamics. Looking at Belgium and Luxembourg, we see that they are more locked down than the typical European country, but they are moving up in the first week of April compared to the last week of March. This is very much in line with their improving strain on the health system.\nWhat is worrying is that there appears to be a significant asynchronicity in the Schengen zone, where people and goods should move around freely. The peripheric countries, which are less densely populated, often less integrated into the global transport and travel routes, are getting into the local epidemics later, and are acting later. This is logical from a national point of view, but given that the European economy is very much integrated, it will prolong the pain. The Netherlands, France and Germany need plenty of seasonal agricultural workers from the Southeast, where the lockdown is just getting really strict. While some of their regions see improving national epidemic situations, the easing will increase the intensity of the local epidemic if a large number of workers will arrive from countries that are just going into the epidemic.\nThe efficient solution, as many public health officials keep saying, would be a synchronized effort to contain the virus. The different pace and strictness of social distancing measures will mean that the local epidemics will not be in synchronization, and the countries will re-infect each other, this way prolonging the economic and social cost of this devastating pandemic. While health policy is a national competence in the European Union, in fact, the European economic and social life is so much integrated, not only within the Schengen Zone, but even with future, prospective and candidate members states in the Balkans, that a far more coordinated public health policy would be required.\nUse this in your article?

Our CEE Music Industry Report 2020 created with the help and support of Consolidated Independent was used as a use case for the problems.\nThis blog post is an edited version of Daniel’s presentation and the subsequent panel discussion with the stakeholders and organizers.\nThe CEE Report builds on the results of the first Hungarian, Slovak, Croatian and Czech music industry reports are compared with Armenian, Austrian, Bulgarian, Lithuanian, Serbian and Slovenian data and findings.\nInvisibility The measurement problems and the ‘invisibility’ of creative and cultural industries is a consequence of the fact that these industries are predominantly comprised of microenterprises and individual, freelancing entrepreneurs. Even larger entities, such as collective management organizations can be classified as small enterprises. In the EU, small- and medium enterprises, and especially microenterprises usually have reduced reporting duties to the statistical authorities and tax authorities (which is the most important secondary source of government statistics in anonymized, aggregated form.) This means that the supply side is not visible for policymakers. The recommendation is to conduct sample-based surveys among these microenterprises, but very few member states do that.\nAnother problem is that on the demand side, not all member states create statistics. ESSNet-Culture created recommendations how to measure cultural access and participation, which is a broader term than cultural consumption, as it includes non-market forms, for example, liturgical music, amateur acting, and so on. The European Commission sometimes makes excellent, but not detailed CAP surveys, which are the most important sources of Eurostat’s relevant pan-European statistics.\nCEEMID has been making such surveys, both on the supply side (in music and film) and in the audience side (in music, film, theatre, opera, and artistic activities) in several member states, and has plenty of experience with using the EU-mandated CAP surveys of 2007 and 2013. The CEE report relies on the latter date set in first part of the audience analysis. Our work was already presented in 2015 as a best use case in Creating better national cultural statistics with Eurobarometer datasets and ESSNet-Culture technical recommendations at GESIS, which maintains the Eurobarometer archives, on the Eurobarometer Symposium Four Decades of Surveying Europe – Perspectives on Academic Research with the European Commission’s Eurobarometer Surveys\nFor the EU the lowest hanging fruit would be to critically assess the past surveys, including the partial CAP survey made in 2017 for the cultural heritage part of culture, and the national surveys conducted by CEEMID and its partners, and to mandate an annual or biannual CAP survey within the Eurobarometer series, probably as a specially sampled “Special Eurobarometer”. This would very significantly reduce the costs compared to a country-to-country basis, and probably could be shared by other institutions, for example, with the European Audiovisual Observatory. This alone would greatly increase the demand / consumption side information on the services of creative and cultural enterprises.\nIn the panel discussion Consolidated Independent highlighted the problem of leaving sample-based statistics making to the industry itself, which leads to myopical incentives to create ‘policy-based evidence’ that is cherry picked by industry trade associations to fit their often not very well thought out policy agenda. In our view, the most important role of a future European Music Observatory would be to set standards to data collection and integration. The music industry is one of the most data-rich industries globally, but the publicly available, verified, trustworthy information is scarce both for policy-making and for business planning among microenterprises who have know specialized research know-how. Our already existing, representative national surveys should and could be extended to the whole Europe with the quality control and visibility offered by such an Observatory.\nIndustry organization A very significant challenge with evidence-based policymaking, or, in fact, with any policy making is that the extremely fragmented nature of the industry makes …","date":1580313600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580313600,"objectID":"e16a23b156aca94ce649126c85162b8d","permalink":"https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-01-30-ceereport/","publishdate":"2020-01-29T16:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-01-30-ceereport/","section":"post","summary":"The Central \u0026 Eastern European Music Industry Report 2020 was presented as a case-study on national and comparative evidence-based policymaking in the cultural and creative sector.","tags":["market report","music industry","CCI","CEEMID","opendata","Armenia","Austria","Bulgaria","Czechia","Lithuania","Hungary","Slovakia","Serbia","Digital Music Observatory"],"title":"CCS Ecosystems: Evidence-Driven CCI Policy \u0026 The Central \u0026 Eastern European Music Industry Report","type":"post"},{"authors":["Daniel Antal"],"categories":null,"content":"CEEMID \u0026amp; Consolidated Independent presented and discussed with stakeholders the Central \u0026amp; Eastern European Music Industry Report 2020 as a case-study on national and comparative evidence-based policymaking in the cultural and creative sector on the CCS Ecosystems: FLIPPING THE ODDS Conference – a two-day high-level stakeholder event jointly organized by Geothe-Institute and the DG Education and Culture of the European Commission with the Creative FLIP project.\nThe CEE Report builds on the results of the first Hungarian, Slovak, Croatian and Czech music industry reports are compared with Armenian, Austrian, Bulgarian, Lithuanian, Serbian and Slovenian data and findings.\nOur research findings were earlier presented and discussed in Vienna, Prague, Budapest and Bratislava with stakeholders.\nYou can find the earlier presentations in the blog section of the website.\nExecutive Summary The first Central European Music Industry Report is the result of a co-operation that started among stakeholders in three EU countries five years ago to measure the economic value added of music – the basis of a modern royalty pricing system. This gave birth to CEEMID, originally the Central \u0026amp; Eastern European Music Industry Databases, a data integration programme that now in 2020, covers all of Europe. CEEMID fulfils similar roles to the planned European Music Observatory and supports all pillars of the future pan-European system.\nThe comparison of Western and Eastern music audiences reveals key demographic differences that make the unchanged adoption of business practices from mature markets in the region questionable. Chapter 2 of this report will show these differences and their consequences on music markets, in terms of visiting and acquisition likelihood, frequency, seasonality and purchasing capacity. This is an example of how CEEMID fulfils the role of Pillar 3 (music, society and citizenship) in the planned European Music Observatory.\nChapter 3 contrasts market demand with the supply strategies of musicians. CEEMID has been surveying music professionals, including artists, technicians and managers about their working conditions, market conditions and plans for five years across a growing number of countries. In 2019 we invited 100 national and regional stakeholders to distribute our surveys. In some countries, our surveys already have several years of historic data, making the resulting musician database probably the largest ever source of data about how music is produced and how musicians live. We are constantly looking for partners to roll out this survey to new countries in new languages.\nThe CEE region has comparative advantages in big music events like festivals, and it has become one of the most important hubs for cultural tourism in the world. We explain this phenomenon in Chapter 4 by showing the differences in demand composition, demography and supply of venues in the second chapter. The lack of a modern and dense network of permanent music venues gave rise to magnificent music festivals in the CEE. Open’er, Sziget and Exit are among the biggest and best festivals in the world, closely followed by several smaller festivals in all countries. The share of festivals in the live music market is many times higher than in Western Europe and they provide vital export revenues to the local music economies. However, they play a limited role in finding new audiences for local artists, as they are increasingly programming for Western audiences by providing shows of international hits. They can only very partially fill in the gaps left by the small venue problem that hit the emerging markets harder than the UK or Australia, where policy action had been already taken to reverse the decline of the availability of smaller live music venues.\nOn the recording side, our analysis shows that modern digital services are growing at a faster rate than in mature markets. Because of lower repertoire competition, streaming quantities are similar for a typical Austrian, Czech, Hungarian, Polish or Slovak track than in the mature markets. However, revenue growth is limited because of the interplay of several analysed factors. Our analysis of the live and recorded music markets shows that CEEMID fulfils the roles of the Pillar 1 (music economy) of the planned European Music Observatory.\nMost recorded music sales revenue in the region comes from streaming platforms, just like in the mature markets. Successful sales strategies require a solid knowledge of the global marketplace and the ability to understand and train sales algorithms. Micro-enterprises, such as independent labels, have very limited ability to cope with these functions, given that they do not have market research or R\u0026amp;D functions. CEEMID and Consolidated Independent have started initiating open, national R\u0026amp;D consortia to create the necessary concentration in data assets, analytical capacity and budgets to close this gap.

In the absence of a fully functional recording market, musicians are more reliant on collective management revenues than in the rest of Europe – yet in many countries collective management has profound difficulty in asking the correct price for music or collecting it.\nWhen analysing the music flows among European countries, and the export-import flows of other emerging markets in Latin America and the worlds most stable ones, like that of the United States, Brazil and Japan, we must realize that these nations face an uphill battle to get into the better paying markets and at the same time to protect their domestic market from increasing import substitution.\nMusic grants could be an important tool to balance the disadvantaged position of CEE musicians in this global competition. Austria and Hungary has a strong popular music support program, but usually the availability and suitability of grants is lower in those countries where musicians and their technical and managerial team would need it most.\nI am very grateful for the support given by Consolidated Independent in the making of this report. CI is the market leader in managed services for the digital music industry, connecting the best independent music with the opportunities of the global market. With their data science team, we put together data from about 700,000,000 royalty statement documents about the whole region.

I always felt that however dynamic are those charts, artists keep complaining that they do not feel these developments. So I started to decompose those growth figures.\nThe Global Music Report quotes national streaming revenues on a dollar basis, which contains a lot of currency exchange noise. And behind the national total there are too many factors: subscriber base growth and repertoire growth and the subscription fee. The interplay of these forces is unpredictable. Whenever a local artist or producers sees a 10% reported national growth, they can never be sure if this will likely cause their sale to grow or shrink.\nBecause of the changes in the subscriber base and the available competing repertoire, it is important to see if the artist’s segment is growing, and if the competition is growing. The sales platforms will never reveal such data, and anyway, there is a competition among many sales platforms. I was looking for an analogy for a similar problem. Securities are a bit similar to songs, they will produce later cash flows, and they are competing for an always changing number of investors and with a constantly changing competition in the investible universe. Songs and their royalty flows exhibit similarities with both equity and bonds, and I believe that a good solution is the creation of song indexes, similarly to stock and bond indexes that represent the performance of various security classes. After many hours of work with the state51 data science team, and at least as much processing work for the servers, we came up with a dataset that contained data from about 700 million royalty statements. I designed a sampling method that is far from perfect, but I think it gives a first birds-eye view on the European markets.\nIn every country and every month, we selected those exploited songs that were in the middle of the exploitation range: as many songs were less listened to as many were more listened too. For simplicity, I call those selected songs the ‘typical songs’ for each streaming platform and royalty territory. I added together the streaming quantities on the three major platforms. For every territory and month, this could have been the sales of a ‘typical’ song.\nLike stock and bond indexes, we can create even more relevant indexes for certain rightsholders. In the Central European Music Industry Report, we will present for each territory a ‘domestic’ and a ‘foreign’ index, because the sales potential of a Slovak song in Slovakia or in Austria is very different from a British song in Slovakia or Austria. In Slovakia, a Slovak song is on a home territory and in Austria in a near territory, while the British song is on one of the almost 200 territories.\nThese findings will be open to discussion on Waves Music Showcase Festival and Conference [click for details] on 27 September 2019.\n","date":1569265200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569265200,"objectID":"085c4e184686adf1eb7a13000ec8bd1e","permalink":"https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2019-09-24_streaming-market/","publishdate":"2019-09-23T19:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-09-24_streaming-market/","section":"post","summary":"Total national sales reflect the growing number of subscribers, the price, the exchange rate, and many factors that are not important for an artists or music label.

For comparison, we added a similar, middle-income emerging market (Argentina) and a rich, small-population English-speaking country, Australia to the chart. These countries seem to be in a similar position to the CEE countries.\nArguably, the strongest countries of songwriting are the United States and Brazil - these are the countries that have ran out of the ISRC recording identifier range. Their charts are full with their domestic songs, but they are not alone. Japan, France, and the bigger EU countries, France, Germany and Poland have very strong domestic performance, too.\nOf course, there are many factor at play here. Large countries with large artist populations generate a lot more recordings, so they local fans always have thousands of new songs to select from. In small countries, the total annual creations, from pop to jazz, from authentic folk to classical amounts to a few thousand tracks. But it is not only size that matters. Sweden’s population is similar to that of Austria, Hungary and Czechia, yet the Swedish repertoire performs better in Sweden, and as we will see in the next chart, abroad, too.\nWe created a second data animation to visualize how hits were travelling across the borders in the summer of 2ö19. To make the chart easier to read, we omitted the United States, Brazil and Japan as countries of origin, and concentrated only on intra-European hit flows.\nThe second week of September 2019 was not an exceptional week. Most EU countries’ producers did not score any hits in any other EU countries’ Spotify Top 50 hits. The UK exported many great hits to all over Europe, as usual, but there were other important hit flows. These hits mainly follow cultural proximity.\nFrance exported hits to the two Francophone countries of Europe, Belgium and Romania, and furthermore to Greece, a Southern country with particularly unique chart composition. Germany exported many hits to Austria, another German-speaking country, and some hits to other Germanic countries. Dutch producers placed a few hits in the Germanic countries and in Belgium, where the Dutch-speaking Flemish community has its own radios, TVs, press and hitlists. The Netherlands is a powerhouse of electronic popmusic that are not bound by language which finds audience in several countries.\nThe strength and competitive position of the national market where an artists is most known and has a fan base is usually a determining factor of track performance and revenue. The overall revenue prospects and competition situation of a Hungarian or Croatian song is very different from a British or even a Polish song. But overall, most European recordings are not bound to a domestic country. Because of cultural proximity, the presence of native minorities or new immigrant diasporas, even small-language songs are being listened to on a much wider territory than the artists’ original country. Some relatively small EU countries, such as Sweden and the Netherlands successfully export their music on a regular basis.\nNevertheless, as the streaming services slowly overtake all other forms of use, the charts above depict a very fundamental market change. Whereas in the traditional channels of physical sales, digital downloads and broadcasting, the CEE countries, like other small- and medium-sized EU countries, enjoyed 30-50% market share, among the streaming hits their producer’s share is below 10%. It is not unusual to find only domestic recordings in physical sales hitlists, while domestic songs rarely enter the streaming charts in the region, with the exception of Poland.\nThe traditional sales channels protected CEE markets in several ways. After EU accession most import duties are gone, but physical products have very significant logistics costs, which gives local producers a competitive edge. Because physical products are increasingly sold on concerts and festivals, where the market share of domestic performers is usually very high, the traditional, mechanically licensed sales had a protected market.\nThe broadcasting channel, which used the be the most important promotion channel, too, was protected in many European countries by national content quotas, or supported with generously funded national, regional, local public broadcasters who gave a preference to national composers, producers and performers. These market barriers are not present in the streaming markets, which poses many questions. Our research is aiming to answer these questions, but it took several years to build a data infrastructure that can help producing an accurate market overview.\nThese findings will be open to discussion on Waves Music Showcase Festival and Conference [click for details] on 27 September 2019.\n","date":1568975400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569263400,"objectID":"4739be7819abcab2e47b964e45e5ff38","permalink":"https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2019-09-23_cross-border_europe/","publishdate":"2019-09-20T10:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-09-23_cross-border_europe/","section":"post","summary":"Which are the European countries that can successfully export songs on a streaming platform?

This is a very good starting point because it makes comparable the rough material standards of musicians and other professional groups in the EU, irrespective of local earnings and living costs.\nMusicians everywhere, including rich countries like Germany, Austria and Slovenia have more problems with paying their bills than the general population in their countries. The only seemingly different country is Bulgaria, but in this case, the self-reported difference is small, and generally Bulgarian musicians and other Bulgarian people have similarly frequent difficulties with paying their bills.\nWorking in an emerging economy is more stressful than in a mature economy – making ends is more difficult, risks are greater and usually rules change faster. No wonder that people generally report higher level of life satisfaction in countries where the living standards are also higher: average life satisfaction in a country is greatly influenced by national income and general health level, measured by life expectancy. However, it is also recorded since the 1970s that after reaching a certain level of living standards, life satisfaction does not increase further with economic conditions. Other factors, such as vocation, work-life balance and political factors play a role, too. Working in an emerging economy is more stressful than in a mature economy – making ends is more difficult, risks are greater and usually rules change faster.\nComparing the life satisfaction levels of musicians with the general public, 2018-2019. .\nIn the emerging music business countries, it is very important to see that the musicians not only earn little money, but as freelancers their income is mainly based on live performances, peaking in the festival season and in December. This income is usually taxed at far higher rates in the CEE region than in Western Europe or in non-creative industries. Royalties, which should balance variable live performance earnings are far lower both as a percentage of total musician income and in euro terms than in advanced markets. This is often coupled with higher taxation, too.\nTo avoid the bias of higher satisfaction levels in richer environments, we measure musician’s self-reported life satisfaction levels against the national averages from the 2018/11 Eurobarometer sample, scaled between the numerical values of -2 (not at all satisfied) to 2 (very satisfied).\nComparing the life satisfaction levels of musicians with the general public, 2018-2019. Our comparison shows that in most of our surveyed countries, musicians are more satisfied with their lives than the average person, despite having more material difficulties. Of course, age, and other factors can contribute to this, but a vocational calling is certainly an important aspect, too. The exceptions are, interestingly, Austria and Slovenia, where the general population has a very high level of life satisfaction, and where both musicians and the general public are generally more satisfied with their lives than in the other countries. In these cases, compared to the general population, music professional are less satisfied with their lives. In Serbia our sample is too small to draw real conclusions.\nComparing the difficulties of paying bills among musicians and the general public, 2018-2019. Career in music can lead to higher life satisfaction than other similarly paid jobs in Europe. However, music market stakeholders should focus on increasing the level of music professional earnings and reducing its variance within the year and over the years, because the material living conditions of musicians is significantly worse than the conditions of the general population.\nYou can read a lot more about this research here.\n","date":1563732000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563738300,"objectID":"b58b684f2c8a1aea2e2a4e251b2f4877","permalink":"https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2019-07-21_life_satisfaction/","publishdate":"2019-07-21T18:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-07-21_life_satisfaction/","section":"post","summary":"Career in music can lead to higher life satisfaction than other similarly paid jobs in Europe.

Spotify pays out about 20% of its royalties to publishers. Because the labels are the bigger stakeholders, they often do not provide the necessary information for work identification in the case of publishers.\nDominic from Netflix is already one of the biggest buyers of music, and I believe that his company’s footprint will just continue growing.

After several years on the stage musician’s got a recording contract, and usually even later they registered their first composition. The recording stream was the most important revenue source. The making of a record was expensive and offered considerable royalties or advances.\nIn the 21st century the live music stream is far more important than the recordings. Creating recordings is much cheaper and stage performances are expensive. Musicians usually create their music, also register it as a music work and offer it to the public on an online portfolio of mp3 downloads, YouTube and music streams. Often they are booked for their first live performance after publishing a recording.\nWhat does it mean for the musician and the manager? First and foremost that traditional career development strategies do not work anymore. A convincing stage performance is mandatory with a good touring strategy. Recordings are often not profitable, but equally important in building the audience. Making the recording stream a revenue stream instead of the cost stream requires a very good understanding of the costs and benefits of the different digital channels.

In policymaking or in social sciences, it is a common practice to compare national statistics, which can be hugely misleading. The United States of America, the Federal Republic of Germany, Slovakia and Luxembourg are all countries, but they differ vastly in size and social homogeneity. Comparing Slovakia and Luxembourg to the federal states or even regions within Germany, or the states of Germany and the United States can provide more adequate insights. Statistically, the similarity of the aggregation level and high number of observations can allow more precise control of model parameters and errors.\nThe advantages of switching from a national level of the analysis to a sub-national level comes with a huge price in data processing, validation and imputation. The package Regions aims to help this process.\nThis package is an offspring of the eurostat package on rOpenGov. It started as a tool to validate and re-code regional Eurostat statistics, but it aims to be a general solution for all sub-national statistics. It will be developed parallel with other rOpenGov packages.\nSub-national Statistics Have Many Challenges Frequent boundary changes: as opposed to national boundaries, the territorial units, typologies are often change, and this makes the validation and recoding of observation necessary across time. For example, in the European Union, sub-national typologies change about every three years and you have to make sure that you compare the right French region in time, or, if you can make the time-wise comparison at all.\nHierarchical aggregation and special imputation: missingness is very frequent in sub-national statistics, because they are created with a serious time-lag compared to national ones, and because they are often not back-casted after boundary changes. You cannot use standard imputation algorithms because the observations are not similarly aggregated or averaged. Often, the information is seemingly missing, and it is present with an obsolete typology code.\nPackage functionality Generic vocabulary translation and joining functions for geographically coded data Keeping track of the boundary changes within the European Union between 1999-2021 Vocabulary translation and joining functions for standardized European Union statistics Vocabulary translation for the ISO-3166-2 based Google data and the European Union Imputation functions from higher aggregation hierarchy levels to lower ones, for example from NUTS1 to NUTS2 or from ISO-3166-1 to ISO-3166-2 (impute down) Imputation functions from lower hierarchy levels to higher ones (impute up) Aggregation function from lower hierarchy levels to higher ones, for example from NUTS3 to NUTS1 or from ISO-3166-2 to ISO-3166-1 (aggregate; under development) Disaggregation functions from higher hierarchy levels to lower ones, again, for example from NUTS1 to NUTS2 or from ISO-3166-1 to ISO-3166-2 (disaggregate; under development) Vignettes / Articles Working With Regional, Sub-National Statistical Products Validating Your Typology Recoding And Relabelling The Typology Of The Google Mobility Reports (COVID-19) Feedback?

The presentation was largely based on analysis of various CEEMID databases.\nThe Central European music industry, as shown by processing the data of more than 2000 musicians in the region is even more reliant on live performances than the British music industry. Even though Croatia appears to be more similar to the UK than the region, a deeper analysis of the data reveals that this is not the case. The most important difference between mature markets and emerging markets is the lack of good distribution and monetization strategy for recorded music.\nCollecting and analyzing industry data is very important for small, national music industries that do not have a large enough repertoire that can be easily promoted on global platforms such as Spotify, Deezer or YouTube. New digital platforms produce relatively low income for Central and Southeastern European artists and labels, but they are growing at a rate similar to mature markets with a short, 1-5 years lag.

Our mandate was to create concrete granting proposals that have a high chance of making a change in terms of the later royalty earning capabilities of artists.\nCEEMID is now part of the Digital Music Observatory. In the first phase of the project, we made two workshops with the eight fields development method to understand the challenges and existing working practices that result in a low level of royalties paid out in Hungary. This methodology requires a groupwork of all stakeholders and professionals of the industry. In this case, we worked in groups of 30-40, covering various artists, stage, light, sound technicians, producers, managers and even band transporters. One group predominantly was Budapest-based and one in Eastern Hungary, to have a different view on working and market conditions in the metropolitan city and in the countryside. While royalties are not applicable for live music, it was well understood by the granting authority and the music industry that royalties cannot grow without a healthy live music sector in the country.\nIn the workshop, the consultant with several aides facilitates a very structured conversation that starts with a desired state of the industry which is not described by slogans but by actual characterizations of a desired working environment. Instead of envisioning that “everybody gets a grant”, we describe the ideal project planning and management cycle of a new tour or record to see how a granting can fit into this workflow and what type of grants add effective assistance to realize goals. For each goal and change we envision how that effects the work of the performing artists, her manager, the technician crew, even the schedule of the tour bus driver. We discuss if the change makes any material change in the way we can prepare for a new album release.\nIn the latter stages what sort of changes we envision in day practices, programmers, institutions and what concrete steps are needed to be made to get there. As a controlling step, we assign indicators that can be objectively judged, and which can show the degree of change if recommended actions are taken.\nThe advantage of the eight-fields methodology, which was originally developed to support EU and global aid program design is that it allows conflicting viewpoints, finding consensus, and display very highly detailed policy and program scenarios already in a day. It is generally a very enjoyable experience for artists and professionals. If the workshop takes place over 2 days, a first draft program is already presented on the second morning and by the end of the day participants usually have a detailed program. In this case, we came up with dozens of concrete proposals, many of which could be addressed to the stakeholders themselves without any action taken from the granting authority.\nIn the next stage we carried out the annual CEEMID Music Professional Survey with additional questions where artists, managers and technicians could rate the proposals. They could also optionally give their next year development priorities in the fields of live performances, recordings and composition, in the context of their current work, pre-existing financing and professional assistance of financial assistance needs. In Hungary, more than 1000 music professionals filled out the survey in 2015.\nAt the end of the workshop and the survey, we could present a very comprehensive policy and granting program, with preliminary estimates on granting needs, ideal and minimum grant sizes, and grant contractual conditions to avoid grant calls that cannot be contracted out to winners due to unrealistic prerequisites.\nThese results, with suggested cultural policy indicators, program indicators and budgetary outlines were presented to the granting authority of the Cseh Tamás Program (currently named: Hangfoglaló Popular Music Support Program)\n","date":1447354800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1447354800,"objectID":"ca02b5b7594b75124728d1397149b66d","permalink":"https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2015-11-12-cstp/","publishdate":"2015-11-12T19:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2015-11-12-cstp/","section":"post","summary":"The data and intelligence of CEEMID was used in Hungary to create an ex ante evaluation of the new Cseh Tamás Program to support popular music development in Hungary.
