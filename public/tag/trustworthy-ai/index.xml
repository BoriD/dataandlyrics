      <title>The Problem of Gender Bias In Machine Translation</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-help-promote-local-music&#34;&gt;How to help promote local music?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study opens the question of the local music promotion within the digital environment.
The Slovak Performing and Mechanical Rights Society (SOZA), the State51 music group in the United Kingdom, and the Slovak Arts Council commissioned Reprex to created a feasibility study which provides recommendations for better use of quotas for Slovak radio stations and which also maps the share and promotion of Slovak music within large streaming and media platforms such as Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;google_translate_EN.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to replicate this problem in several languages — English, Dutch, French, and German — and I am quite certain that the list could grow. What is going on here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;google_translate_DE.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sie sieht sehr gut aus. Und er siet dumm aus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;google_translate_FR.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elle est belle. Il est intelligent.
I treat Data Feminism, the magnum opus of Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein as a guidebook to all sorts of power-related problems in big data, not only those specifically pertaining to womxn. The reason why Slovak artists of any gender are less likely to be recommended by a music streaming platform are similar to why Google Translate assumes “the professor” is a “he” every time. In this case, of course, the problems of data and power that we see so clearly represented here do specifically deal with gender and sexism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;google_translate_NL.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
Ze is aan het winkelen. Hij gaat naar huis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[T]he past data in question (like segregated housing patterns or single parentage) are products of structurally unequal conditions. These unequal conditions are true across large social groups, and yet the technology uses those data as predictive elements that will influence one person’s future. […] This is one of the challenges of using data about people as an input into a system: the data are never “raw.” Data are always the product of unequal social relations — relations affected by centuries of history. As computer scientist Ben Green states, “Although most people talk about machine learning’s ability to predict the future, what it really does is predict the past.” — 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mitsap.medium.com/data-feminism-ad4263858321&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Introduction to Data Feminism&lt;/a&gt; by Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that Google has “read” all books, translations, dictionaries and whatever it can get its proverbial hands on, as well as recording for years how people use and correct its translation tool. In a patriarchal society, more men drive buses then women, and women are more often considered and described as beautiful than they are strong. Google considers the most used translation in the past the one that is most likely to be correct in future cases.
(To Google’s credit, if you enter only a single term, not an entire text, it explains the problem. The Hungarian language does not use gendered nouns and pronouns — even though Hungarian society is quite patriarchal in other ways!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big data reenforces existing power imbalances because it projects the past into the present and the future, through numbers and language. As a study published by the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://fra.europa.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;European Union Agency For Fundamental Rights&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2020/artificial-intelligence-and-fundamental-rights&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Getting the future right — Artificial intelligence and fundamental rights argues, justice and equality are fundamental rights&lt;/a&gt;. Accordingly, everyone must have the right to challenge an algorithm that discriminates against them, in music streaming, recruitment processes, or other contexts, in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, a transparent, accountable, trustworthy AI is one that constantly checks for biases and changes them. This is the reason why black-box, proprietary algorithms can do more harm than good. If you want to correct injustices in music streaming, in everyday language use, or in a recruitment process, you must be able to verify the training dataset of an algorithm, its working principles, and its outcome as unbiased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our startup has initiated several collaborations open for citizen scientists, individual artists, universities and corporations as well to create validated, trustworthy datasets to train accountable algorithms. We are currently focusing on music and climate change, and will start new data programs in other cultural and environmental areas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Feasibility Study On Promoting Slovak Music In Slovakia &amp; Abroad</title>
      <link>/post/2021-03-25-listen-slovak/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-help-promote-local-music&#34;&gt;How to help promote local music?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study opens the question of the local music promotion within the digital environment.
The Slovak Performing and Mechanical Rights Society (SOZA), the State51 music group in the United Kingdom, and the Slovak Arts Council commissioned Reprex to created a feasibility study which provides recommendations for better use of quotas for Slovak radio stations and which also maps the share and promotion of Slovak music within large streaming and media platforms such as Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;















&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-what-should-a-good-local-content-policy-radio-quota-recommendation-system-streaming-quota-achieve&#34;&gt;

    What should a good local content policy (radio quota, recommendation system, streaming quota) achieve?
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study proposes best practices for the introduction of mandatory quotas for Slovak radio stations and points out how current recommendation systems used by large platforms such as Spotify, YouTube, or Apple hardly consider local music from smaller countries. Local music stands against competition consisting of million songs from the whole world, and for ordinary Slovak musicians, whose music doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong to the global hits playlists, it is almost impossible to get recommended by the recommendation systems of large platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

    We aimed to create a demo version of a utility-based, transparent, accountable recommendation system.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution to this problem could be the Listen Local App, built on a comprehensive reference database of local music, which we created as a demo version within the study. The app aims to help listeners discover more local music; the app also presents new and alternative ways for large digital platforms to recommend local artists. Through Listen Local, listeners search for artists and bands based on their taste and the city they are situated in. In this way, listeners can easily search for music by artists from particular cities or from the town they are about to visit.
We are releasing today the feasibility study in English and Slovak. We call for an open consultation to evaluate the results of this work and continue developing the Slovak Music Database, the Listen Local recommendation, and the AI validation system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;database&#34;&gt;Database&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Slovak Music Database is connected to Reprex&amp;rsquo;s flagship project, the Demo Music Observatory, an open collaboration-based demo version of the planned European Music Observatory, currently being further developed in the JUMP Music Market Accelerator Programme supported by Music Moves Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project website contains the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://listenlocal.community/project/demo-sk-music-db/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;demo version of the Slovak Music Database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-steps&#34;&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next phase of the work, we add further data to our Slovak Demo Music Database and carry out more and more experiments and educational activities to understand how Slovak music can become more visible and targeted. We are also bringing this project into an international collaboration for better utilization of R&amp;amp;D efforts and experiences throughout Europe. This agile project method originated in reproducible scientific practice and open-source software development and allows participation in large projects on any scale: from individual musicians and educators to large research universities and music distributors. Anyone can join in on the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reprex is looking for further international partners; Reprex is currently part of the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://reprex.nl/post/2021-02-16-nlaic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dutch AI Coalition&lt;/a&gt; and the

SOZA and Reprex are committed to opening this project for international collaboration while ensuring that a significant part of the R&amp;amp;D activities remains in the Slovak Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are preparing informal, online information sessions for artists, promoters, researchers, and developers to join our project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Feasibility Study On Promoting Slovak Music In Slovakia &amp; Abroad</title>

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, realizing the low visibility and income-generating potential of Slovak music, the legislation introduced an amendment to the broadcasting act to regulate local content in radiostreams. The Slovak content promoting policy was well-intended but not based on any impact assessment, and it reached its goal only partially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Slovak broadcasting quotas in comparison with other national quotas a very simple, and they are impossible to measure, which makes both compliance and enforcement very difficult. Radio editors do not get any help to find music that fits into the playlists and fulfill the quota obligations – in many cases, it is impossible for them to find out if a song actually meets the quota requirements. For the same reason, neither is enforcement possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another deficiency of the broadcasting quotas is that because of its fuzzy target, it is not clear whom it tries to help, and it has few friends. It is unclear how performers, composers or Slovak music producers can benefit from the system. Furthermore, it only helps a few genres, and it decreases the chances of other Slovak music in instrumental and non-Slovak language genres (for example, classical, jazz, rock) to be heard.&lt;/p&gt;

    What should a good local content policy (radio quota, recommendation system, streaming quota) achieve?
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And at last, radio is losing its importance in music discovery. New generation find the music during their music discovery age on YouTube and digital streaming platforms. A Slovak content promoting policy that does not work on digital streaming platforms will be obsolete when radio content providers will switch to digital streaming in the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Feasibility Study follows the following logic:&lt;/strong&gt;
In the first chapter we introduce various music recommendation systems in the context of local content promotion polices, like local mandatory content quota regulations.&lt;/p&gt;















&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-we-aimed-to-create-a-demo-version-of-a-utility-based-transparent-accountable-recommendation-system&#34;&gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;/img/streaming/mind_map_recommendations.jpg&#34; data-caption=&#34;We aimed to create a demo version of a utility-based, transparent, accountable recommendation system.&#34;&gt;

    We aimed to create a demo version of a utility-based, transparent, accountable recommendation system.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second chapter, we consider the market-based or creative industry economy supporting policy goals, measurements, and potential support given to artists and producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then turn in the third chapter to content-based local regulations promoting the use of the Slovak language or Slovak music content, irrespective of the performers and producers nationality, residence or ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We introduce the idea of the &lt;strong&gt;Slovak Music Database&lt;/strong&gt;, a comprehensive, mainly opt-in, opt-out database that of Slovak artists and Slovak music that should be supported by the local content regulation and other policies. We also create a Demo Slovak Music Database to understand the problem and scope of the creation of the comprehensive version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project website contains the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://listenlocal.community/project/demo-sk-music-db/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Slovak Music Database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also created a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://listenlocal.community/project/demo-app/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Recommendation System&lt;/a&gt;. We explain here

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;research-questions&#34;&gt;Research questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why are the total market shares of Slovak music relatively low both on the domestic and the foreign markets?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we measure the market share of the Slovak music in the domestic and foreign markets?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we measure the value gap between what some media platforms, most particularly the biggest YouTube, does not pay out to the Slovak stakeholders within Slovakia?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the interplay of the various definitions on market share and national quota targets?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How ‘shadow-markets’ of home copying and unlicensed media platforms, such as YouTube impact market shares directly and national quotas indirectly?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can modern data science, predictive microeconomics and statistics help increase the market share of Slovak music in Slovakia and abroad?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to continue this work in more depth in Slovakia, and include new countries and regions, for example, Estonia, Hungary, the Netherlands, Flanders and Wales in the next versions. We are also planning city-version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;https://listenlocal.community/#about&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; is an open initiative for musicians and music organizations to create new, open AI applications that make locally relevant music visible online and offline. Listen Slovak is our first demonstration project, accompanied with a Feasibility Study. It was created jointly with the Slovak Performing Rights Society, and with the support of the Slovak Arts Council and Consolidated Independent, a music distributor company for independent labels and artist. Our aim was to understand why some Slovak music cannot be heard on radio and on streaming platforms, and to create a database and a demo application that makes that music discoverable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>/post/2021-02-13-european-visibility/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The majority of music sales in the world is driven by AI-algorithm powered robots that create personalized playlists, recommendations and help programming radio music streams or festival lineups. It is critically important that an artist’s work is documented, described in a way that the algorithm can work with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our research paper – soon to be published – made for the Listen Local Initiative we found that 15% of Dutch, Estonian, Hungarian, or Slovak artists had no chance to be recommended, and they usually end up on 
&lt;a href=&#34;post/2020-11-17-recommendation-analysis/&#34;&gt;Forgetify&lt;/a&gt;, an app that lists never-played songs of Spotify. In another project with rights management organizations, we found that about half of the rightsholders are at risk of not getting all their royalties from the platforms because of poor documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how come that distributors give streaming platforms songs that are not properly documented?  What sort of information is missing for the European repertoire’s visibility?  Reprex is exploring this problem in a practical cooperation with SOZA, the Slovak Performing and Mechanical Rights Society, and in an academic cooperation that involves leading researchers in the field. A manuscript co-authored Martin Senftleben, director of the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ivir.nl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Institute for Information Law&lt;/a&gt; in Amsterdam, and eminent researchers in copyright law and music economics, Reprex’s co-founder makes the case that Europe must invest public money to resolve this problem, because in the current scenario, the documentation costs of a song exceed the expected income from streaming platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the European Strategy for Data, the European Commission highlighted the EU’s ambition to acquire a leading role in the data economy. At the same time, the Commission conceded that the EU would have to increase its pools of quality data available for use and re-use. In the creative industries, this need for enhanced data quality and interoperability is particularly strong. Without data improvement, unprecedented opportunities for monetising the wide variety of EU creative and making this content available for new technologies, such as artificial intelligence training systems, will most probably be lost. The problem has a worldwide dimension. While the US have already taken steps to provide an integrated data space for music as of 1 January 2021, the EU is facing major obstacles not only in the field of music but also in other creative industry sectors. Weighing costs and benefits, there can be little doubt that new data improvement initiatives and sufficient investment in a better copyright data infrastructure should play a central role in EU copyright policy. A trade-off between data harmonisation and interoperability on the one hand, and transparency and accountability of content recommender systems on the other, could pave the way for successful new initiatives.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our 
&lt;a href=&#34;post/2020-12-17-demo-slovak-music-database/&#34;&gt;Slovak Demo Music Database&lt;/a&gt; project is a best example for this. We started systematically collect publicly available information from Slovak artists (in our write-in process) and ask them to give GDPR-protected further data (in our opt-in process) to create a comprehensive database that can help recommendation engines as well as market-targeting or educational AI apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that one of the problems of current AI algorithms that they solely or almost only work with English language documentation, putting other, particularly small language repertoires at risk of being buried below well-documented music mainly arriving from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are looking for rightsholders and their organizations, artists, 
researchers to work with us to find out how we can increase the visibility of European music.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We want to help small organizations with big data.&lt;/strong&gt; Big data creates inequalities. Only the largest corporations, government bureaucracies, and scientific organizations have the human financial resources to create large, consistent datasets. We help our clients to access datasets of sufficient size, and to build trustworthy scientific, policy, business, or AI applications with the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our new website, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://reprex.nl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;reprex.nl&lt;/a&gt; leaves the two flagship project &amp;mdash; 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://listenlocal.community/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; pages intact, and connects through our service offering. The Data&amp;amp;Lyrics blog will remain open for many interesting topics that we find interesting for our partners, friends, readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-access&#34;&gt;Data Access&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reprex grew out of CEEMID, a project that connected data and pooled surveys across twelve countries and over fifty music industry stakeholders to create thousands of relevant policy, statistical, and scientific indicators for the music and creative industries. (See the Central European Music Industry Report 2020 at 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ceereport2020.ceemid.edu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ceereport2020.ceemid.edu&lt;/a&gt;.) Reprex offers services to help small organizations access data and use data in a trustworthy way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-use-research-automation--trustworthy-ai&#34;&gt;Data Use: Research Automation &amp;amp; Trustworthy AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI requires large datasets to be effective, small organizations face challenges in harnessing the benefits of algorithms &amp;mdash; or, worse, biased algorithms created for different purposes will work against their strategic goals. We want to help our clients with pooling, sharing data, and validating or creating trustworthy applications.&lt;/p&gt;
