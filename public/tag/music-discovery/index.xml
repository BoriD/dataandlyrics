      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is various global and national research available on the music discovery demography.  People usually discover new music in their young age as they are forming their own personal identity with their peer group.  This process mainly happens in the school, where similarly aged, educated young people spend much of their day together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music discovery phase is strongly related to the time when most people get their music education: their skills to listen to music, play music or sing, and to compose new music. Investment into music education pays of in later age: people with more diverse music education, for example, with the ability to play music, tend to visit concerts more or discover more music in later life stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For practical reasons and supported by academic research, we chose the age group 15-24 as the key age group for music discovery.  Our main indicator is the national population of the music discovery age group.&lt;/p&gt;
