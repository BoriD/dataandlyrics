      <title>The Healing Effect of Sound and Music</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flower of Sound invites you to become more calm, inspired, energized or focused. Let the stress flow away and elevate your own frequency. Claudio is a fellow in the JUMP European Music Accelerator Program with a particularly interesting Milano and Amersfoort based startup, Flower of Sound. I visited him and his co-founder, Elise,in Seats2meet Amersfoort CS. I found their approach particularly interesting because the model of music streaming is already being overtaken by informative radio-style programming in the form of podcasts and, next to that, all sorts of functional sounds that help people to meditate, drown out noise in a co-working space, or just simply fall asleep. They made me realize that the boundary between the music market and something larger is becoming very thin, maybe disappearing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Claudio_Vittori_JUMP.png&#34; alt=&#34;Claudio Vittori&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are you talking about sound and not music? How can immersive sound have a positive affect on you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claudio: We are talking about sound because we work with all kinds of auditory input, from very specific frequencies to nature sounds and ASMR (whisper voice). When you talk about music there is always a very specific assumption that there is a melody, or it is a comforting listening experience. We choose instead the possibility of healing as our core. For example, listening to just a pure tone can actually be a bit uncomfortable but it does have an effect on your body and mental state. The sound can create, for example, sonic illusions by activating certain specific areas in the brain, allowing people to recover memories of trauma from the past. Thanks to new technologies like neurofeedback we can formulate a proper sound therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe title=&#34;vimeo-player&#34; src=&#34;https://player.vimeo.com/video/307457833&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;466&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We work with immersive sound because it can have a higher positive effect than normal stereo sound for different reasons. In sound healing therapy, the different sound sources (for instance, Tibetan bowls) are often placed on the body or within someone’s energy field. With the use of spatial sound you can recreate this and let the body react in almost the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By creating an immersive experience, you enhance the overall effect. Think of going to the cinema compared to watching a movie on your phone: it opens up a new world of creativity and unexpected effects, because it is so new, and this element of surprise and awe creates an even more positive feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where is the boundary between sound design and music creation? How do you end up in a ‘music market accelerator’ with a sound design project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in an overlapping area because, with the way we have set up 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://flowerofsound.machinejockey.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Flower of Sound&lt;/a&gt;, we are both part of the music industry and also part of the “wellbeing” world. We want to distribute all our albums via the normal streaming services from Tidal to Spotify and Amazon HD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, we are creating a platform for a group of musicians, healers, and artists that have not found their way into the normal music world. For instance, we have recorded a sjaman playing his sound healing music, and from this we will create a spatial album and a VR experience. We will create, with the help of advanced sound design techniques, “neuro music” products for specific purposes from tantra training to stimulating neural activities, headache or nausea treatment. As you can see, we are far from music and closer to a medicine approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1ZcPitJYc15PCQdNGSrNeK&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a performer and as an inventor, what is the relevance of your location to you? How do you connect to your audience, your ecosystem in Milano? How will this change with virtualizing the experience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more we go virtual the more there is also a need for real life connection. So on the one end, it doesn’t matter where all of us are based, as long as we have access to high-speed internet. On the other hand, real life encounters will become more rare and precious: basically what is happening now during all these lockdowns. So it will come down to making careful decisions about when to travel to create these real life experiences, and at the same time making sure that with virtual communication channels we keep in touch and keep creating the intimacy that is needed to perform and create new projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;393&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y1jQHudtpzU&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out Claudio Vittori&amp;rsquo;s Collateral Nature debut album 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://machinejockey.net/collateral-nature-morning-mars-eng/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Morning Mars&lt;/a&gt;. The album has ten original tracks of which half are instrumental.  The album is enriched with immersive contents and produced in Stereo, binaural and Dolby Atmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elise, you have a background in book publishing and distribution. As an experienced book publisher and a book couch, what insights can you bring into the music market? What has surprised you the most on this journey?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Elise-de-Bres-boekcoach-slider-home.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Elise on boekcoach.nl&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elise&lt;/em&gt;: My number one insight is: &lt;em&gt;Why does the music industry make everything so complicated?&lt;/em&gt; So I am looking for ways to make things simpler so we can be as effective as we can. As a book coach and publisher I work with the rules of the book industry, but I am also always looking for ways to go around the industry to make a book more successful. Why is a book considered “old” three months after its release, for instance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am fascinated by how cultural the book industry is, from the way it’s organised to the details of which covers work best. This also applies to the music industry. What I will bring with me is that the basis of everything should be the why of a piece of music. And making sure that why is honoured throughout, because I believe that is the only way to bring it into fruition. So in our case we want to create a healing effect in combination with technology, so that will always be the core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almost no startups succeed without a good mix of co-founders. How did you find your co-founder, and what inspires you to go on after a setback or a disappointing day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Claudio_Elise.png&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;ldquo;Claudio and Elise&amp;rdquo;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elise: Finding a good co-founder is a combination of luck, knowing what you are looking for, and brutal honesty. I have different business partners for my other companies and the dynamic with each of them is different, but at the basis is trust in each other and sharing the same core values. For both of us, what inspires us is our shared vision of the future what we want to reach with Flower of Sound. There is this underlying feeling that we have to bring this into the world. Nowadays everybody knows what kinds of miracles sound and music perform on people; thanks to technology, now we can go further to discover the mechanisms behind why certain frequencies and rhythms affect our mood and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are both fellows in the JUMP European Music Market Accelerator program. What are your expectations from this program?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are hoping to find knowledge and help to bring forward our application as soon as possible; and to find the right people to propel us forward, good team members, and investors so we can really accelerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claudio, can you recommend us something to hear, visit, listen to physically in Milano once this pandemic is over?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claudio: One, you need to listen to 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.collateralnature.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Collateral Nature&lt;/a&gt;, a hybrid music project that combines sound design and jazz through different immersive experiences, from a VR music clip to a Metaverse experience via WebXR, a Dolby Atmos format, and other new media content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then visit Ride, a temporary space for the urban arts (Milan Porta Genova MM2, May — September 2021), where a Flower of Sound immersive room will be installed in June with Atmos layout speakers.
Next: Base (Via Bergognone, Design District) with 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://zero.eu/en/luoghi/194380-la-capsula,milano/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Capsula&lt;/a&gt;, a 360 immersive audio layout, and Meet the Media Guru Center of Arts, an international artistic installation of new media.
And close by is the Navigly area: a lot of bars, great cocktails, and a great atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And Elise, can you tell us what to hear, visit, listen to physically in Amersfoort once the pandemic has ended?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elise&lt;/em&gt;: What I recommend in Amersfoort is to go to the city centre and just walk around the old town. Then wander towards what is called the “new city” and have a coffee there. Visit 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.seats2meet.com/nl/locations/322/Seats2meet-Amersfoort-CS&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Seats2meet Amersfoort CS&lt;/a&gt; for a meeting or co-work time and also see our immersive room at 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://speel-veld.nl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Speel-veld.nl&lt;/a&gt;. Amersfoort is really just in the middle of the Netherlands. We have a big tower in the city centre to prove it. We also have a lot of really cool festivals, from street theatre to food, to salsa and traditional Dutch music.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lapee: Making Festivals More Accessible For Women</title>
      <link>/post/2021-03-10-lapee/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 19:19:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/2021-03-10-lapee/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gina Périer is a fellow in the JUMP European Music Market Accelerator. She is an architect trying to solve a serious problem before music festivals reopen after the pandemic: many, many women, all in one place… who need to pee.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your personal connection to music and festivals?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I like going to festivals, partying and listening to the concerts. Then, I used to work as an architect for Roskilde Festival in Denmark, together with my co-founder Alexander. For us, it was a great opportunity to observe the impact of our design on the festival and on the crowd behavior. We started then observing issues around and trying to find simple solutions to improve the festival environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;lapee_efficiency.png&#34; alt=&#34;Efficiency of urinals&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lapee gives womxn the ability to pee in a secure and clean environment without waiting in line. Apart from personal experience, what sort of research did you do to understand the scope of the problem and the potential market? How do you feed back user experience to the design process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While being at the festival that I was working for, I was extremely concerned about how difficult it was to just pee as a womxn. No matter how much fun I was having, when it comes to pee, everything turns into a nightmare because we know we’re on to a good struggle. We’ll probably lose our friends, miss half of the concert, stay in an endless line to finally lock ourselves into a sticky cabin. Many times we would go for the “other option,” commonly known as the bushes, which is quite unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking around the festival populated with male urinals, it was quite hard to understand why there wasn’t a proper industrialized solution for womxn yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;lapee_design.png&#34; alt=&#34;Urinal designed for women&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we started drawing Lapee, we made some 1/1 cardboard models and we invited different womxn to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you name another product or service that help womxn to participate more in music, either as members of the audience, or as creators, or technicians that you like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/clubmafia99/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;clubmafia99.png&#34; alt=&#34;clubmafia99&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that safety is still quite an issue within the music industry. I have a friend who created an organisation, Club Mafia, which consists of having a community of people that can educate and help people in trouble or making trouble. Basically they are people in between safety guards and participants that are easier to reach out to and that are more understanding and value minded. They will listen to you if you feel uncomfortable and will go and explain to the person how not to make someone uncomfortable. I think it’s a great initiative!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say that the major problems I can observe in music are sexism, queerphobia and racism, and some ideas can help fighting against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I hope for more ideas that can improve equality. I also really hope for music organisations to speak up, be inclusive, promote better equality and not tolerate sexism, queerphobia and racism. The audience should educate themselves and organisations should use their power and influence to speak and educate their audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You were selected to JUMP along with us. What do you expect to gain from this European Music Accelerator?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to develop a great relevant network and make Lapee a normality in festivals :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In our 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/listen-local/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; project, we try to bypass recommendation and gatekeeper biases and make sure that local music scenes are connected to local people, and not colonized by the global music industry. Can you recommend any bands, labels, or local festivals from the area where you live?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Gina is very vocal that the product is meant to be a safe, quick, comfortable choice for everybody who identifies as a woman, but it should not be viewed as a unisex solution. “Who ever identifies as women or femme, and feels safer squatting, is more than welcome to use Lapee. Boys you pee literally e-v-e-r-y-w-h-e-r-e, leave some space for the girls please. Thanks!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the announcement of JUMP, the European Music Market Accelerator, after a careful screening of all applications received, the selection committee composed of all JUMP board members has selected the most promising ideas and projects to be developed together with renowned tutors for this 2021 fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nine months, the 20 fellows living in many European countries will develop their innovative projects, while receiving a comprehensive 360° training. In addition to specialised workshops by highly qualified experts, each fellow will receive one-on-one tutoring sessions from the most renowned music professionals coming from all over Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20 selected projects cover a great variety of urgent needs faced within the music sector.
They will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;help fostering social change with projects focusing on diversity in the industry, more fairness and
transparency as well as raising awareness on timely issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enhance technological development with projects using blockchain, immersive sound and VR and AR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;build bridges between different key actors of the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Antal, co-founder of Reprex, and co-editor of Data &amp;amp; Lyrics, was selected into 2021 Fellowship program of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jumpmusic.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;JUMP, the European Music Market Accelerator&lt;/a&gt;. Jump provides a framework for music professionals to develop innovative business models, encouraging the music sector to work on a transnational level.  The European Music Market Accelerator composed of MaMA Festival and Convention, UnConvention, MIL, Athens Music Week, Nouvelle Prague and Linecheck support him in the development of our two, interrelated projects over the next nine months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://reprex.nl/project/music-observatory/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; is a demo version of the European Music Observatory based on open data, open source, automated research in open collaboration with music stakeholders. We hope that we can further develop our business model and find new users, and help the recovery of the festival and live music segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://reprex.nl/project/listen-local/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; is our AI system that validated third party music AI, such as Spotify&amp;rsquo;s or YouTube&amp;rsquo;s recommendation systems, and provides trustworthy, accountable, transparent alternatives for the European music industry. We hope to expand our pilot project from Slovakia to several European countries in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
