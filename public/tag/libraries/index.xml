      <description>&lt;p&gt;Please give us ideas, comments to our pre-print manuscript, which is available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3785272&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SSRN&lt;/a&gt; our for &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/media/publications/SSRN-id3785272.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;direct download&lt;/a&gt; here on Data &amp;amp; Lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the European Strategy for Data, the European Commission highlighted the EUâ€™s ambition to acquire a leading role in the data economy. At the same time, the Commission conceded that the EU would have to increase its pools of quality data available for use and re-use. In the creative industries, this need for enhanced data quality and interoperability is particularly strong. Without data improvement, unprecedented opportunities for monetising the wide variety of EU creative and making this content available for new technologies, such as artificial intelligence training systems, will most probably be lost. The problem has a worldwide dimension. While the US have already taken steps to provide an integrated data space for music as of 1 January 2021, the EU is facing major obstacles not only in the field of music but also in other creative industry sectors. Weighing costs and benefits, there can be little doubt that new data improvement initiatives and sufficient investment in a better copyright data infrastructure should play a central role in EU copyright policy. A trade-off between data harmonisation and interoperability on the one hand, and transparency and accountability of content recommender systems on the other, could pave the way for successful new initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
