      <title>dataset: Create Interoperable FAIR Datasets</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/software/dataset/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/software/dataset/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;interoperable-fair-datasets&#34;&gt;Interoperable, FAIR datasets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary aim of dataset is create well-referenced, well-described,
interoperable datasets from data.frames, tibbles or data.tables that
translate well into the W3C DataSet definition within the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Data Cube
Vocabulary&lt;/a&gt; in a reproducible
manner. The data cube model in itself is is originated in the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sdmx.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange&lt;/a&gt;, and it is
almost fully harmonzied with the Resource Description Framework (RDF),
the standard model for data interchange on the web[^1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mapping of R objects into these models has numerous advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes data importing easier and less error-prone;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leaves plenty of room for documentation automation, resulting in far
better reusability and reproducability;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The publication of results from R following the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;FAIR&lt;/a&gt; principles is far
easier, making the work of the R user more findable, more
accessible, more interoperable and more reusable by other users;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes the placement into relational databases, semantic web
applications, archives, repositories possible without time-consuming
and costly data wrangling (See &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataset.dataobservatory.eu/articles/RDF.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;From dataset To
RDF&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our package functions work with any structured R objects (data.fame,
data.table, tibble, or well-structured lists like json), however, the
best functionality is achieved by the (See &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataset.dataobservatory.eu/articles/dataset.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The dataset S3
Class&lt;/a&gt;), which
is inherited from &lt;code&gt;data.frame()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;code-of-conduct&#34;&gt;Code of Conduct&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that the &lt;code&gt;dataset&lt;/code&gt; project is released with a

      <title>statcodelists: Use Standardized Statistical Codelists</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/software/statcodelists/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/software/statcodelists/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;retrospective-data-harmonization&#34;&gt;Retrospective data harmonization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of &lt;code&gt;retroharmonize&lt;/code&gt; is to provide tools for reproducible
retrospective (ex-post) harmonization of datasets that contain variables
measuring the same concepts but coded in different ways. Ex-post data
harmonization enables better use of existing data and creates new
research opportunities. For example, harmonizing data from different
countries enables cross-national comparisons, while merging data from
different time points makes it possible to track changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retrospective data harmonization is associated with challenges including
conceptual issues with establishing equivalence and comparability,
practical complications of having to standardize the naming and coding
of variables, technical difficulties with merging data stored in
different formats, and the need to document a large number of data
transformations. The &lt;code&gt;retroharmonize&lt;/code&gt; package assists with the latter
three components, freeing up the capacity of researchers to focus on the
first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the &lt;code&gt;retroharmonize&lt;/code&gt; package proposes a reproducible
workflow, including a new class for storing data together with the
harmonized and original metadata, as well as functions for importing
data from different formats, harmonizing data and metadata, documenting
the harmonization process, and converting between data types. See
&lt;a href=&#34;https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/reference/retrohamonize.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
for an overview of the functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;code&gt;labelled_spss_survey()&lt;/code&gt; class is an extension of &lt;a href=&#34;https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/labelled_spss.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;haven’s labelled_spss class&lt;/a&gt;. It not
only preserves variable and value labels and the user-defined missing
range, but also gives an identifier, for example, the filename or the
wave number, to the vector. Additionally, it enables the preservation –
as metadata attributes – of the original variable names, labels, and
value codes and labels, from the source data, in addition to the
harmonized variable names, labels, and value codes and labels. This way,
the harmonized data also contain the pre-harmonization record. The
stored original metadata can be used for validation and documentation
purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vignette &lt;a href=&#34;https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/articles/labelled_spss_survey.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Working With The labelled_spss_survey Class&lt;/a&gt;
provides more information about the &lt;code&gt;labelled_spss_survey()&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/articles/harmonize_labels.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Harmonize Value Labels&lt;/a&gt;
we discuss the characteristics of the &lt;code&gt;labelled_spss_survey()&lt;/code&gt; class and
demonstrates the problems that using this class solves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also provide three extensive case studies illustrating how the
&lt;code&gt;retroharmonize&lt;/code&gt; package can be used for ex-post harmonization of data
from cross-national surveys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;!-- HERE I WOULD INCLUDE A BREIF INTRODUCTION ABOUT WHO MARIE IS AND WHY WE&#39;RE INTERVIEWING HER
Please go ahead and extend it

--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the sieges of the World War II, Sarajevo, Europe has another horrible siege.  The Russian invading forces have surrounded Kharkiv, Ukraine&amp;rsquo;s second largest city, the home in peacetime of 1.4 million people. In the city, KharkivMusicFest planned to present the 5th music festival. Concerts were to take place with the participation of a world-famous classical musicians who had had never given a concert in Ukraine before.  The Russian military invasion changed the program but did not cancel the festival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;395&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6JN3yWqiyuk&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KharkivMusicFest in 2022 takes place on the metro station &lt;em&gt;Historical Museum&lt;/em&gt;, currently a shelter from bombs for many Ukrainian children, women, and elderly. The opening event, &amp;ldquo;Concert between explosions&amp;rdquo;, has been performed by the ensemble of Olga Pyshchyta (violin), Stanislav Kucherenko (violin), Tetyana Zhuk (viola), Denis Karachevtsev (cello)  and Serhiy Dikarev (double bass) performed masterpieces of classical music by Bach, Schubert, Dvorak and Skoryk together with arrangements of Ukrainian folk songs specially created for this concert by a young Kharkiv composer and conductor Volodymyr Bohatyrev.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In spite of the difficult times for our city, under the explosions and the roar of cannonade, KharkivMusicFest remains with the people of Kharkiv. The war has been going on for a month and all possible words of support for Kharkiv residents have been said many times. But the language of music is multifaceted, it will surely find its way to the heart of each of us&amp;mdash;to support, motivate, inspire or soothe. And the main thing is that in spite of everything in the destroyed by bombs and shells, but unconquered Kharkiv, classical music will still be heard,&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;says Maria Gorbonos, executive director of the festival.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ensuring the Visibility and Accessibility of European Creative Content on the World Market: The Need for Copyright Data Improvement in the Light of New Technologies</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/publication/european_visibilitiy_2022/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/publication/european_visibilitiy_2022/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the European Strategy for Data, the European Commission highlighted the EU’s ambition to acquire a leading role in the data economy. At the same time, the Commission conceded that the EU would have to increase its pools of quality data available for use and re-use. In the creative industries, this need for enhanced data quality and interoperability is particularly strong. Without data improvement, unprecedented opportunities for monetising the wide variety of EU creative and making this content available for new technologies, such as artificial intelligence training systems, will most probably be lost. The problem has a worldwide dimension. While the US have already taken steps to provide an integrated data space for music as of 1 January 2021, the EU is facing major obstacles not only in the field of music but also in other creative industry sectors. Weighing costs and benefits, there can be little doubt that new data improvement initiatives and sufficient investment in a better copyright data infrastructure should play a central role in EU copyright policy. A trade-off between data harmonisation and interoperability on the one hand, and transparency and accountability of content recommender systems on the other, could pave the way for successful new initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>From Play to Rec</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-12-03-rec_to_play/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 14:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-12-03-rec_to_play/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We met in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jumpmusic.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;JUMP European Music Market Accelerator&lt;/a&gt; in spring, but for me, your project became clear when I saw your demonstration in &lt;a href=&#34;https://the-walrus.fr/record-store-paris-walrus/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Walrus Record Store&lt;/a&gt; in Paris, during the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mamafestival.com/en/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MaMA showcase festival&lt;/a&gt;. I love record stores - I used to have a collection of CDs, and my father a collection of vinyl’s. Are record store’s important locations in your project? Do you have a favorite record shop?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s actually the first time we made an &lt;em&gt;Open Studio Session&lt;/em&gt; in a record shop. And it felt very natural. Record shops are a very important place for me I&amp;rsquo;m trying to build one, dedicated to independent artists and record labels, in Toulouse, where I live. So, it means a lot to me, that we made this Open Studio Session with &lt;em&gt;Suzanne Belaubre&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Walrus Record&lt;/em&gt; shop. The most inspiring record shop I have seen are in London. The one from Erased Tapes, is very small but very special to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;394&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/AVLMiUscHDc&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The other thing I liked a lot about your project is that it brings the attention to the importance of localities, that music ecosystems are usually small geographies. Not all artists have a global fanbase, or can go on an international tour, even if there is no pandemic. How do your project fit into local ecosystems?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you said, a lot of artists have a local fan base and even when artists are big, they always have a special bond with the audience and the city they come from. The idea behind the Open Studio Sessions is to allow artists to open up in front of a very restricted audience and show themselves from a creative and working perspective. They put themselves in a vulnerable position and the audience gets to be very close to the artists. I believe it&amp;rsquo;s a way for people to see their local artists from a new perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We both tried to further develop our projects in JUMP. What was the most important learning for you in these 9 months, when you were together with other entrepreneurs, trainers, mentors and visited several music cities?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned through this program is to dare. Dare to contact people, dare to ask for help. When you get to meet loads of professionals of the music industry in such a short time, you realize, you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to be quick, seize the moment to dare talk with them and share your ideas, your ambitions. This program also pushed me to recruit people to work with to become more efficient in my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Open Studio Sessions. started out from a documentary film project. What happened with the film?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s true. I started to produce a documentary series. I made a pilot episode and three episodes of that documentary series. Each episode following a new artist through the making of a song. I had been discussing possibilities of diffusion with a production company and a French TV channel. After a few months the TV channel had changed their mind and I was already getting started with the Open Studio Sessions, which were working pretty well. So, I decided to suspend the documentary series. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get back to it one day. The episodes I made are still available on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you have any ambitions to extend your project beyond France, to Belgium or even further to us in the the Netherlands?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would to. I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on the first Open Studio Session Tour in France. The next step would be to make a European Open Studio Session Tour. I already collaborated with a few Belgium artists when working on the documentary series. It would be an honor to work with them again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adding Value to Public Data With Imputation and Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-11-06-indicator_value_added/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Public data sources are often plagued by missng values. Naively you may think that you can ignore them, but think twice: in most cases, missing data in a table is not missing information, but rather malformatted information. This approach of ignoring or dropping missing values will not be feasible or robust when you want to make a beautiful visualization, or use data in a business forecasting model, a machine learning (AI) applicaton, or a more complex scientific model. All of the above require complete datasets, and naively discarding missing data points amounts to an excessive waste of information. In this example we are continuing the example a not-so-easy to find public dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-11-08-indicator_findable/&#34;&gt;In the next  blogpost&lt;/a&gt; we explain how we added value by documenting data following the &lt;em&gt;FAIR&lt;/em&gt; principle and with the professional curatorial work of placing the data in context, and linking it to other information sources, such as other datasets, books, and publications, regardless of their natural language (i.e., whether these sources are described in English, German, Portugese or Croatian).

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completing missing datapoints requires statistical production information (why might the data be missing?) and data science knowhow (how to impute the missing value.) If you do not have a good statistician or data scientist in your team, you will need high-quality, complete datasets. This is what our automated data observatories provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-is-data-missing&#34;&gt;Why is data missing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International organizations offer many statistical products, but usually they are on an ‘as-is’ basis. For example, Eurostat is the world’s premiere statistical agency, but it has no right to overrule whatever data the member states of the European Union, and some other cooperating European countries give to them. And they cannot force these countries to hand over data if they fail to do so. As a result, there will be many data points that are missing, and often data points that have wrong (obsolete) descriptions or geographical dimensions. We will show the geographical aspect of the problem in a separate blogpost; for now, we only focus on missing data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some countries have only recently started providing data to the Eurostat umbrella organization, and it is likely that you will find few datapoints for North Macedonia or Bosnia-Herzegovina. Other countries provide data with some delay, and the last one or two years are missing. And there are gaps in some countries’ data, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a headache if you want to use the data in some machine learning application or in a multiple or panel regression model. You can, of course, discard countries or years where you do not have full data coverage, but this approach usually wastes too much information&amp;ndash;if you work with 12 years, and only one data point is available, you would be discarding an entire country’s 11-years’ worth of data. Another option is to estimate the values, or otherwise impute the missing data, when this is possible with reasonable precision. This is where things get tricky, and you will likely need a statistician or a data scientist onboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-can-we-improve&#34;&gt;What can we improve?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider that the data is only missing from one year for a particular country, 2015. The naive solution would be to omit 2015 or the country at hand from the dataset. This is pretty destructive, because we know a lot about the radio market turnover in this country and in this year! But leaving 2015 blank will not look good on a chart, and will make your machine learning application or your regression model stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A statistician or a radio market expert will tell you that you know more-or-less the missing information: the total turnover was certainly not zero in that year.  With some statistical or radio domain-specific knowledge you will use the 2014, or 2016 value, or a combination of the two and keep the country and year in the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our improved dataset added backcasted (using the best time series model fitting the country&amp;rsquo;s actually present data), forecasted (again, using the best time series model), and approximated data (using linear approximation.) In a few cases, we add the last or next known value.  To give a few quantiative indicators about our work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased number of observations: 65%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduced missing values: -48.1%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased non-missing subset for regression or AI: +66.67%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your organization is working with panel (longitudional multiple) regressions or various machine learning applications, then your team knows that not havint the +66.67% gain would be a deal-breaker in the choice of models and punctuality of estimates or KPIs or other quantiative products. And that they would spent about 90% of their data resources on achieving this +66.67% gain in usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you happen to work in an NGO, a business unit or a research institute that does not employ data scientists, then it is likely that you can never achieve this improvement, and you have to give up on a number of quantitative tools or visualizations. If you  have a data scientist onboard, that professional can use our work as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;can-you-trust-our-data&#34;&gt;Can you trust our data?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that you can trust our data better than the original public source. We use statistical expertise to find out why data may be missing. Often, it is present in a wrong location (for example, the name of a region changed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are reluctant to use estimates, think about discarding known actual data from your forecast or visualization, because one data point is missing.  How do you provide more accurate information? By hiding known actual data, because one point is missing, or by using all known data and an estimate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our codebooks and our API uses the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sdmx.org/?page_id=3215/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange&lt;/a&gt; documentation standards to clearly indicate which data is observed, which is missing, which is estimated, and of course, also how it is estimated.
This example highlights another important aspect of data trustworthiness. If you have a better idea, you can replace them with a better estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our indicators come with standardized codebooks that do not only contain the descriptive metadata, but administrative metadata about the history of the indicator values. You will find very important information about the statistical method we used the fill in the data gaps, and even link the reliable, the peer-reviewed scientific, statistical software that made the calculations. For data scientists, we record the plenty of information about the computing environment, too-–this can come handy if your estimates need external authentication, or you suspect a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;avoid-the-data-sisyphus&#34;&gt;Avoid the data Sisyphus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you work in an academic institution, in an NGO or a consultancy, you can never be sure who downloaded the &lt;a href=&#34;https://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=sbs_na_1a_se_r2&amp;amp;lang=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Annual detailed enterprise statistics for services (NACE Rev. 2 H-N and S95)&lt;/a&gt; Eurostat folder from Eurostat. Did they modify the dataset? Did they already make corrections with the missing data? What method did they use? To prevent many potential problems, you will likely download it again, and again, and again&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

These datasets will be preserved for decades, and nobody can manipulate them. You cannot accidentally overwrite them, and we have no backdoor access to modify them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Can We Add Value to Public Data With Better Curation And Documentation?</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-11-08-indicator_findable/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-11-08-indicator_findable/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this example, we show a simple indicator: the &lt;em&gt;Turnover in Radio Broadcasting Enterprises&lt;/em&gt; in many European countries. This is an important demand driver in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/#pillars&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music economy pillar&lt;/a&gt; of our Digital Music Observatory, and important indicator in our more general &lt;a href=&#34;https://ccsi.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Cultural &amp;amp; Creative Sectors and Industries Observatory&lt;/a&gt;. We show a very similar example in our &lt;em&gt;Green Deal Data Observatory&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://greendeal.dataobservatory.eu/post/2021-11-08-indicator_findable/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;environmental R&amp;amp;D public spending in Europe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dataset comes from a public datasource, the data warehouse of the
European statistical agency, Eurostat. Yet it is not trivial to use:
unless you are familiar with national accounts, you will not find &lt;a href=&#34;https://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=sbs_na_1a_se_r2&amp;amp;lang=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this dataset&lt;/a&gt; on the Eurostat website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our version of this statistical indicator is documented following the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;FAIR principles&lt;/a&gt;: our data assets
are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. While the
Eurostat data warehouse partly fulfills these important data quality
expectations, we can improve them significantly. And we can also
improve the dataset, too, as we will show in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-11-06-indicator_value_added/&#34;&gt;next blogpost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;findable-data&#34;&gt;Findable Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data observatories add value by curating the data&amp;ndash;we bring this
indicator to light with a more descriptive name, and we place it in
context with our &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Digital Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ccsi.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Cultural &amp;amp; Creative Sectors and Industries Observatory&lt;/a&gt;.
While many people may need this dataset in the creative sectors, or
among cultural policy designers, most of them have no training in working with
national accounts, which imply decyphering national account data codes in records that measure economic activity at a national level. Our curated data observatories bring together many available data around important domains. Our &lt;em&gt;Digital Music Observatory&lt;/em&gt;, for example, aims to form an ecosystem of music data users and producers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We added descriptive metadata that help you find our data and match it
with other relevant data sources. For example, we add keywords and
standardized metadata identifiers from the Library of Congress Linked
Data Services, probably the world’s largest standardized knowledge
library description. This ensures that you can find relevant data
around the same key term (&lt;a href=&#34;https://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85110448.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;radio broadcasting&lt;/a&gt;)
in addition to our turnover data. This allows connecting our dataset unambiguosly
with other information sources that use the same concept, but may be listed under
different keywords, such as &lt;em&gt;Radio–Broadcasting&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Radio industry and
trade&lt;/em&gt;, or maybe &lt;em&gt;Hörfunkveranstalter&lt;/em&gt; in German, or &lt;em&gt;Emitiranje
radijskog programa&lt;/em&gt; in Croatian or &lt;em&gt;Actividades de radiodifusão&lt;/em&gt; in
Portugese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;accessible-data&#34;&gt;Accessible Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data is accessible in two forms: in csv tabular format (which can be
read with Excel, OpenOffice, Numbers, SPSS and many similar spreadsheet
or statistical applications) and in JSON for automated importing into
your databases. We can also provide our users with SQLite databases,
which are fully functional, single user relational databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a
specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a
row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This makes the data
easier to clean, and far more easier to use in a much wider range of
applications than the original data we used. In theory, this is a simple objective,
yet we find that even governmental statistical agencies&amp;ndash;and even scientific
publications&amp;ndash;often publish untidy data. This poses a significant problem that implies
productivity loses: tidying data will require long hours of investment, and if
a reproducible workflow is not used, data integrity can also be compromised:
chances are that the process of tidying will overwrite, delete, or omit a data or a label.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Join us for a coffee on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://reprex.nl/talk/digital-music-observatory-on-the-mama-convention-2021/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MaMA Convention 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music industry has envied the television and film industry which has a single go-to-point for data when it needs them, the European Audiovisual Observatory. It started lobbying for a publicly financed music observatory. But we did not wait. The music industry has a tragic track record of failed centralized international data projects. We built Reprex out of a 12-country, decentralized music project. We learned how to utilize hidden, but already existing data and research funds well, and how to manage the data governance among the poisonous conflicts of interests between rich and poor countries, authors vs producers, producer’s vs performers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Digital Music Observatory is not theoretical, it is practical, because it is built around real-life court cases, damage claims, lobbying and PR arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Digital Music Observatory is comprehensive – it contains more than a thousand indicators from all European countries. We have enough data to test the biases of the Spotify or the YouTube algorithm – you would be surprised what the data tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has data available much sooner, in much higher quality and in a more practical format than in the Audiovisual one.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Empirical Analysis of Music Streaming Revenues and Their Distribution</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/publication/mce_empirical_streaming_2021/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/publication/mce_empirical_streaming_2021/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Owing to the global nature of music earnings, the various currency translation and royalty payments applied, and because there is no global comprehensive database of rights-holders, works, and recordings, it is impossible to calculate average (mean) or typical (median) earnings with any accuracy. Even an estimate would require a very complex methodology. Understanding the earnings of an average rights-holder would require a careful disaggregation of volume, price, exchange rate, and distribution changes, and international data harmonisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimating average or typical income requires advanced empirical sampling or surveying methods. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Digital Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; (previously CEEMID) has worked on developing such methods, with the support of the state51 music group. We commissioned a report from the Digital Music Observatory on the earnings of UK rights-holders and this can be found here at &lt;a href=&#34;https://zenodo.org/record/5554089&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;the Digital Music Observatory&amp;rsquo;s Zenodo repository&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Among the Observatory’s findings are that use of streaming services is generally growing in terms of volume, but the price is diminishing, which leads to diminishing or flat earnings for a typical or average British rights-holder; that in the 2015-2019 period, falling prices were partly or fully compensated by favourable changes in the exchange rate of the British pound with major currencies used in the global music business (the US dollar, the euro and the Japanese yen), but since 2020 there may have been changes in the opposite direction; and that for various methodological reasons, without international data harmonisation, and survey harmonisation, it is impossible to take a fully representative, unbiased sample of music
creator earnings in the United Kingdom alone.&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Music Creator&amp;rsquo;s Earnings in the Digital Era, p28.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;exectuive-summary-of-our-research-document&#34;&gt;Exectuive Summary of Our Research Document&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research questions asked in this report are related to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/music-creators-earnings-in-the-digital-era&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music Creator Earnings&amp;rsquo; Project&lt;/a&gt; (MCE), exploring issues concerning equitable remuneration and earnings distributions. We were tasked with providing a longitudinal analysis of earnings development and relating our findings to equitable remuneration. The starting point of our work was centred around a very broadly defined problem: how much money music creators (rightsholders) earn from streaming, how these earnings are distributed, and how the earnings and their distribution have developed during the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highly globalized music industry generates two important international reports, as well as several national reports, but these are not suitable for the analysis of the typical or average rightsholder, nor for small labels and publishers who do not represent a large and internationally diversified portfolio of music works or recordings. Copyright and neighboring right revenues are collected in national jurisdictions. Because British artists are almost never constrained by their use of language, and the UK Music Industry is highly competitive in the global music markets, even relatively less known rightsholders earn revenues from dozens of national markets. The lack of market information on music sales volumes, prices for each jurisdiction, and the unaccounted for national, domestic, and foreign revenues makes the analysis of the rightholder’s earnings, or the economics of a certain distribution channel like music streaming or media platforms, impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While total earnings are reported by international and national organizations, they hide five important economic variables: changes in sales volumes, changes in prices, market share on various national jurisdictions (which have their own volume and price movements), the exchange rates applied, and the share of the repertoire exploited. Even worse, the global music industry has no comprehensive database of rightsholders, music works, and recordings. Many rights are represented by heirs or passive investors. And because of the enormous number of works and recordings, in any given royalty payment period, most works/recordings are not used and not compensated. The lack of a known population and distribution makes usual indicators as average or median earnings arithmetically impossible to compute, and the large number of disused works and recordings makes even the estimation of the typical (median) value useless for economic analysis. The estimation of the arithmetic mean is equally problematic, because it is distorted by the earnings of very few global stars. To understand the streaming economy from the perspective of a typical or average rightsholder, or from the perspective of a small independent label or music publisher, requires very challenging sampling techniques either in surveying or in empirically observing and aggregating data from royalty accounts. National and international music organizations are not equipped with the data processing and statistical capacity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the problem that the Digital Music Observatory, a working demo of the European Music Observatory is solving. It grew out of the Central &amp;amp; Eastern European Music Industry Databases (CEEMID) initiative in 2014, in which righthsolders from three countries attempted to solve this problem. By 2019, CEEMID had collected information on 20 European markets, including the United Kingdom, and processed data on far more markets. The state51 music group, through its distribution arm, has been supporting the creation of the largest ever European market report, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Central European Market Report&lt;/a&gt;, and supported the creation of the CEEMID-CI indexes, which, for the first time provided a stock-index type of view from an individual rightsholder’s perspective on volume and price movements in the UK and in other countries. The state51 music group drew attention to the observatory approach and this work in the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (DCMS) Select Committee of the British House of Commons. The MCE project first individually contacted the Digital Music Observatory (successor of CEEMID) and state51, and eventually with the permission of state51, the project commissioned this report, which re-uses the CEEMID-CI indexes. The MCE project also committed to share data in the Digital Music Observatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first chapter is divided into three subchapters: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mce.dataobservatory.eu/intro.html#theoretical-challenges&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;1.1&lt;/a&gt; the theoretical problems imposed by copyright law and intellectual property valuation methods; &lt;a href=&#34;https://mce.dataobservatory.eu/intro.html#policy-issues&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;1.2&lt;/a&gt; policy issues related to the copyright management problems that lead to large amounts of unpaid royalties and value transfer, as well as potential problems with AI distribution systems and royalty distribution rules; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mce.dataobservatory.eu/intro.html#empirical-challenges&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;1.3&lt;/a&gt; identifying and offering solutions for empirical problems in estimating the relevant earnings indicators for individual rightsholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second chapter presents the CEEMID-CI indexes, and gives an explanation to the seemingly paradoxical situation of total market growth, and the feeling of individual righthsolders that their earnings remain flat or decreasing. We show in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mce.dataobservatory.eu/empirical.html#streaming-value&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;2.1&lt;/a&gt; that revenues that are flat or slightly growing are caused by growing volumes and falling prices (See &lt;a href=&#34;https://mce.dataobservatory.eu/empirical.html#streaming-volume&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;2.2 https://mce.dataobservatory.eu/empirical.html#streaming-volume&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;https://mce.dataobservatory.eu/empirical.html#streaming-price&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;2.3  CEEMID-CI Streaming Price Index&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third chapter, using computer simulations, gives a fuller picture. It shows that in the UK and many other markets, in the period of 2016-2019, the growth of streaming use hardly offset the diminishing price (value) of the streams. In many markets, rightsholders, expressed in British pounds, experienced flat earnings, which was by a large extent due to the benevolent USD/GBP, EUR/GBP, and CHF/GBP exchange rates. It is likely that the majority of individual rightsholders experienced flat or diminishing revenues, and later releases brought less and less revenue per a thousand streams. A less benevolent exchange rate environment could have brought very large losses of revenue (See &lt;a href=&#34;https://mce.dataobservatory.eu/simulation-results.html#exchange-rate-effects&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;3.4&lt;/a&gt; for more details.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our computer simulations show that British rightsholders are experiencing a rather varied picture of music streaming. Because of the generally falling value of streams, short-lived hits are more impacted by value decline than perennial hits (See subchapters &lt;a href=&#34;https://mce.dataobservatory.eu/simulation-results.html#difference-popularity&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;3.1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mce.dataobservatory.eu/simulation-results.html#release-time&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;3.2&lt;/a&gt;.) Rightsholders with a diversified international audience are partly shielded by these effects (See &lt;a href=&#34;https://mce.dataobservatory.eu/simulation-results.html#difference-international&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;3.3&lt;/a&gt;.) Younger stars and new genres generally experience a windfall from the pro-rata distribution system and older artists with more conventional genres such as rock or blues are experiencing headwinds. The publicly available market totals are hiding completely different market experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MCE project and its stakeholders did not provide us with any data. Our detailed data from other jurisdictions, however, shows that music streaming has been successfully competing with other sales/distribution formats of music partly because it was much cheaper, and generally devalued music-related rights. This is particularly the case with media platforms like YouTube. For the UK, which is not planning to adopt new EU regulations, closing the value gap is an important policy task. We also show on the example of other countries that current policy debate in the UK around the re-definition of equitable remuneration rigths, or on the pro-rata or user-centrique distribution schemes, are gaining excessive focus, and changes in these aspects of the streaming ecosystem will solve the problems of few, if any, rightsholders. We believe that the music industry must look beyond the current practices of streaming pricing and distribution, for example, to telecommunication services, and investigate the adoption of a more just system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our report highlights some important lessons. First, we show that in the era of global music sales platforms it is impossible to understand the economics of music streaming without international data harmonization and advanced surveying and sampling. Paradoxically, without careful adjustments for accruals, market shares in jurisdictions, and disaggregation of price and volume changes, the British industry cannot analyze its own economics because of its high level of integration to the global music economy. Furthermore, the replacement of former public performances, mechanical licensing, and private copying remunerations (which has been available for British rightsholders in their European markets for decades) with less valuable streaming licenses has left many rightsholders poorer. Making adjustments on the distribution system without modifying the definition of equitable remuneration rights or the pro-rata distribution scheme of streaming platforms opens up many conflicts while solving not enough fundamental problems.  Therefore, we suggest participation in international data harmonization and policy coordination to help regain the historical value of music.&lt;/p&gt;

Weighing costs and benefits, there can be little doubt that new data improvement initiatives and sufficient investment in a better copyright data infrastructure should play a central role in EU copyright policy.

      <title>Music Creators’ Earnings in the Streaming Era</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-09-23-mce_reports/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-09-23-mce_reports/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reprex was commissioned to prepare an analysis on the justified and not justified differences in music creators’ earnings.  We have posted our most important findings in an earlier blogpost (&lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/post/2021-06-18-mce/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music Creators’ Earnings in the Streaming Era. United Kingdom Research Cooperation With the Digital Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Intellectual Property Office has published the entire report on the music creators’ earnings, and we have made our detailed analysis available in a side-publication. Reprex also signed an agreement with the researchers of the Music Creators’ Earnings project to deposit all data published in the report in the Digital Music Observatory, and to promote the building of the observatory further.
The research questions asked in this report are related to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/music-creators-earnings-in-the-digital-era&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music Creator Earnings&amp;rsquo; Project&lt;/a&gt; (MCE), exploring issues concerning equitable remuneration and earnings distributions. We were tasked with providing a longitudinal analysis of earnings development and relating our findings to equitable remuneration. The starting point of our work was centred around a very broadly defined problem: how much money music creators (rightsholders) earn from streaming, how these earnings are distributed, and how the earnings and their distribution have developed during the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highly globalized music industry generates two important international reports, as well as several national reports, but these are not suitable for the analysis of the typical or average rightsholder, nor for small labels and publishers who do not represent a large and internationally diversified portfolio of music works or recordings. Copyright and neighboring right revenues are collected in national jurisdictions. Because British artists are almost never constrained by their use of language, and the UK Music Industry is highly competitive in the global music markets, even relatively less known rightsholders earn revenues from dozens of national markets. The lack of market information on music sales volumes, prices for each jurisdiction, and the unaccounted for national, domestic, and foreign revenues makes the analysis of the rightholder’s earnings, or the economics of a certain distribution channel like music streaming or media platforms, impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While total earnings are reported by international and national organizations, they hide five important economic variables: changes in sales volumes, changes in prices, market share on various national jurisdictions (which have their own volume and price movements), the exchange rates applied, and the share of the repertoire exploited. Even worse, the global music industry has no comprehensive database of rightsholders, music works, and recordings – this is the data gap that we would like fill with the Digital Music Observatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&#34;https://mce.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; highlights some important lessons. First, we show that in the era of global music sales platforms it is impossible to understand the economics of music streaming without international data harmonization and advanced surveying and sampling. Paradoxically, without careful adjustments for accruals, market shares in jurisdictions, and disaggregation of price and volume changes, the British industry cannot analyze its own economics because of its high level of integration to the global music economy. Furthermore, the replacement of former public performances, mechanical licensing, and private copying remunerations (which has been available for British rightsholders in their European markets for decades) with less valuable streaming licenses has left many rightsholders poorer. Making adjustments on the distribution system without modifying the definition of equitable remuneration rights or the pro-rata distribution scheme of streaming platforms opens up many conflicts while solving not enough fundamental problems.  Therefore, we suggest participation in international data harmonization and policy coordination to help regain the historical value of music.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/media/img/blogposts_20121/dcms_economics_music_streaming.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of our Digital Music Observatory was brought to the UK policy debate on music streaming by the &lt;em&gt;Written evidence submitted by The state51 Music Group&lt;/em&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;Economics of music streaming review&lt;/em&gt; of the UK Parliaments&amp;rsquo; DCMS Committee&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music industry requires a permanent market monitoring facility to win fights in competition tribunals, because it is increasingly disputing revenues with the world’s biggest data owners. This was precisely the role of the former CEEMID&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; program, which was initiated by a group of collective management societies. Starting with three relatively data-poor countries, where data pooling allowed rightsholders to increase revenues, the CEEMID data collection program was extended in 2019 to 12 countries.The &lt;a href=&#34;https://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;final regional report&lt;/a&gt;, after the release of the detailed &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/publication/hungary_music_industry_2014/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/publication/slovak_music_industry_2019/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Slovak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/publication/private_copying_croatia_2019/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Croatian reports&lt;/a&gt; of CEEMID was sponsored by Consolidated Independent (of the &lt;em&gt;state51 music group&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEEMID was eventually to formed into the &lt;em&gt;Demo Music Observatory&lt;/em&gt; in 2020&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, following the planned structure of the  &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-16-european-music-observatory-feasibility/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;European Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, and validated in the world&amp;rsquo;s 2nd ranked university-backed incubator, the Yes!Delft AI+Blockchain Validation Lab. In 2021, under the final name &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Digital Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, it became open for any rightsholder or stakeholder organization or music research institute, and it is being launched with the help of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-03-04-jump-2021/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;JUMP European Music Market Accelerator Programme&lt;/a&gt; which is co-funded by the Creative Europe Programme of the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2020, we started investigating how the music observatory concept could be introduced in the UK, and how our data and analytical skills could be used in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://digit-research.org/research/related-projects/music-creators-earnings-in-the-streaming-era/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music Creators’ Earnings in the Streaming Era&lt;/a&gt; (in short: MCE) project, which is taking place paralell to the heated political debates around the DCMS inquiry. After the &lt;em&gt;state51 music group&lt;/em&gt; gave permission for the UK Intellectual Property Office to reuse the data that was originally published as the experimental &lt;a href=&#34;https://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/market.html#recmarket&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CEEMID-CI Streaming Volume and Revenue Indexes&lt;/a&gt;, we came to a cooperation agreement between the MCE Project and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Digital Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt;. We provided a detailed historical analysis and computer simulation for the MCE Project, and we will host all the data of the &lt;em&gt;Music Creators’ Earnings Report&lt;/em&gt; in our observatory, hopefully no later than early July 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;!-- HERE I WOULD INCLUDE A BREIF INTRODUCTION ABOUT WHO MARIE IS AND WHY WE&#39;RE INTERVIEWING HER
Please go ahead and extend it

--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marie works in Prague, and helps musicians&amp;rsquo; careers, particularly in TV and feature film synchronization.  She is also a performing artists, whose music is connected to different parts of Europe. We interviewed her because of our shared interest in how music crosses borders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, you&amp;rsquo;re currently living in Prague, after spending several years located in France, London, and Berlin. What was this journey like for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got locked down in Prague actually. I intended to move to Berlin after leaving London, as my pianist lives there and has kids. It seemed like the best next destination, but it just didn’t work out. Lockdown came out of the blue and I decided to stay in Czech Republic. I eventually found an apartment in Prague and a job I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to do all my life, so I think this is it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now work for a label and I am in charge of our sync &amp;amp; publishing department. My professional focus is still abroad for the most part which helps me work towards my ambitions, yet also come back to my roots. I feel like this is what I really needed for my creativity to strive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- HERE I WOULD INCLUDE A BREIF INTRODUCTION ABOUT WHO MARIE IS AND WHY WE&#39;RE INTERVIEWING HER--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where would you like to find an audience for your music?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a great question, one that is hard to answer in my case since I am local in several places. I would say that because my songs are in English and draw inspiration from Irish and British folk music - I started writing when I found Lisa Hannigan and her melody based songs - they will resonate with people in these territories more than they probably will in Czechia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider myself a storyteller. My music is a space to communicate emotions about experiences we might not always talk about. I love performing live and I can see myself doing this anywhere, but mostly in Europe. I feel very close to all the countries I’ve lived in, so France and even the UK. I always build a small fanbase where I live, and then uproot again.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to spend more time in Central and Eastern Europe too. I feel like I neglected these countries and quite unfairly so. This has been a challenge as touring is always an expense, and since I collaborate with a pianist who has two children, there are practical aspects that I have to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I am not performing much these days. I channeled all my passion for it into my work with other artists and have been a booker, a manager, a filmmaker, a producer, an event organiser, and just kept on learning about the industry whilst swimming in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen Local tries to connect local musicians with local music. Can we say that you are looking for audiences that can be reached from Berlin and Prague, so Western Czechia and the Southeastern part of Germany? Our app is designed to find out where you music mind find audience, and for music lovers, to find artists who are close enough  to visit on a small venue gig.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you could say this is the territory where I would like people to listen to my music. I released my songs which were recorded eight years after we wrote them. Spotify became more dominant in release strategy and I had very little understanding of how it worked, what to pay attention to and how much time goes into release planning. I just decided to put the songs up, and let them live their own life. Now that I know much more about digital, I want to be more intentional about the songs I put out and how I do it. I love visual expression, I love collaboration, and I feel that the spaces I choose to live in &amp;ndash; which I choose because they are beautiful &amp;ndash; play an important role in this. I want to tell the story of how everything lead to where I am now. I always figured it was important to highlight small artist locally and where they performed so that audiences could connect with them and follow them long after, so what you are doing is great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having moved around, what do you consider home, in a spiritual or physical sense?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France is really my sacred place. It is a place where I feel insanely inspired and at home. Even from miles away, it gives me a sense of confidence and freedom. I lived in the mountains for six years, and I loved it because it was a place where you needed to rely on yourself to survive. There is no industry there so anything I wanted to exist, I had to create everything myself. And that was amazing, because I proved to myself that I could do anything I decided to. When you are in a city, you always have to ask permissions. As a woman in this industry, no one listens to you. You have to work triple hard for people to let you say or do something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I come back to the mountains for consolation, really. I even changed my French surname to mean “from the mountains,” as a way for people to stop focusing on where I am from and more on what I do. It worked, and I became Marie De La Montagne. I identified with that name so much, I had a hard time using my civil surname in my professional life when I became a publisher. Me and my colleague had a lot of laughs about it. It just seemed so strange to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My other source of inspiration in music is in America. A lot of people might judge me for saying that, but America doesn’t do what I  mentioned above. I don’t feel so smothered when I work with my American colleagues. When I started to work with supervisors and people around the entertainment industry, I saw new potential, and my storytelling side resonated there. So I aligned myself at that, and wish to connect all these places creatively and also use the opportunities they offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you recommend some music from the region of France where you feel at home? Or some music from the US that inspired you much recently? We are interested in how musical inspiration comes to our artists, physically. We want to understand how music travels via word of mouth, algorithms, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can point you to a few artists that I met and find so inspiring. Definitely Amistat, a twin duo who have Czech roots, lived in Australia, and now live in Germany. We worked together for about two years, and I could listen to their song Love &amp;amp; Light on repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also love &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0pylMlxf_0jE256FLv9ZMg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dirt Miller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8dfUJJ-3op3B5wF5uono0w&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Lauren Ruth Ward&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom I met in Los Angeles, and I think that they are geniuses. Their songwriting, their social media artistry, and their vocals are mad!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--  Please add links similarly  --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many artists in Prague who have their own approach to songwriting and I am a huge fan of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqMfd-lCgyHkd2EYbjwaxDA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Aiko’s&lt;/a&gt;. I love Bookie Baker, especially when they play live. Karel Havlíček who just released a neoclassical album Spoken is someone who inspires me so much with his understanding of being an artist. Out of the artists I met whilst I was in France - check out Jake Morley, Nyna Loren, Fionnuala McKenna, Rob Longstaff, The Pedestrians&amp;hellip; so many great artists! Many of these artists came with us on tour which we filmed, so you can check out the videos we made online as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are currently not performing much, instead you are helping other artists.  What is your day job?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My day job now is building a sync &amp;amp; publishing company under a big independent label, which isn’t an easy task and exactly what I love about it. I need to have these big projects that build on the values I mentioned above. We offer all kinds of deals which evolve around artist development. My main focus is synchronization in TV and film, though mostly not in the Czech market. The industry here is not as standardized as it is abroad, and as you probably know through your research, this comes at a great disadvantage for the artists. I want to challenge that, as I feel like music is universal, and the industry is a tool not a master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In your work supporting artists, do you ever use data to help them find an audience?  What are your challenges?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yes! Data are my daily companion. But the challenges are everywhere, starting with artists not even knowing that they need data and what for. And clearing data is incredibly timeconsuming. I keep striving to find ways to understand the insides of the industry better using data so I can compensate for the disadvantages that the Czech market faces by default - language, historical disconnection from the markets around, the small size of the market, and so on. I also know a few people who are very passionate about this topic and new trends in music, in legal, in digital… There are so many ways you can look at this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We really would need more time to talk :)!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;















&lt;figure  id=&#34;figure-sisyphus-was-punished-by-being-forced-to-roll-an-immense-boulder-up-a-hill-only-for-it-to-roll-down-every-time-it-neared-the-top-repeating-this-action-for-eternity--this-is-the-price-that-project-managers-and-analysts-pay-for-the-inadequate-documentation-of-their-data-assets&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/media/img/blogposts_2021/Sisyphus_Bodleian_Library.png&#34; alt=&#34;Sisyphus was punished by being forced to roll an immense boulder up a hill only for it to roll down every time it neared the top, repeating this action for eternity.

      Sisyphus was punished by being forced to roll an immense boulder up a hill only for it to roll down every time it neared the top, repeating this action for eternity.  This is the price that project managers and analysts pay for the inadequate documentation of their data assets.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When was a file downloaded from the internet?  What happened with it sense?  Are their updates? Did the bibliographical reference was made for quotations?  Missing values imputed?  Currency translated? Who knows about it – who created a dataset, who contributed to it?  Which is an intermediate format of a spreadsheet file, and which is the final, checked, approved by a senior manager?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big data creates inequality and injustice. On aspect of this inequality is the cost of data processing and documentation – a greatly underestimated, and usually not reported cost item. In small organizations, where there are no separate data science and data engineering roles, data is usually supposed to be processed and documented by (junior) analysts or researchers.  This a very important source of the gap between Big Tech and them: the data usually ends up very expensive, ill-formatted, not readable by computers that use machine learning and AI. Usually the documentation steps are completely omitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Data is potential information, analogous to potential energy: work is required to release it.” &amp;ndash; Jeffrey Pomerantz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metadata, which is information about the history of the data, and information how it can be technically and legally reused, has a hidden cost. Cheap or low-quality external data comes with poor or no metadata, and small organizations lack the resources to add high-quality metadata to their datasets. However, this only perpetuates the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;metadata-unbillable-hours&#34;&gt;The hidden cost item behind the unbillable hours&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have shown with our research partners, such metadata problems are not unique to data analysis.  Independent artists and small labels are suffering on music or book sales platforms, because their copyrighted content is not well documented.  If you automatically document tens of thousands of songs or datasets, the documentation cost is very small per item. If you, do it manually, the cost may be higher than the expected revenue from the song, or the total cost of the dataset itself. (See our research consortiums&amp;rsquo; preprint paper: &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/publication/european_visibilitiy_2021/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ensuring the Visibility and Accessibility of European Creative Content on the World Market: The Need for Copyright Data Improvement in the Light of New Technologies&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short run, small consultancies, NGOs, or as a matter of fact, musicians, seem to logically give up on high-quality documentation and logging.  In the long run, this has two devastating consequences: computers, such as machine learning algorithms cannot read their documents, data, songs.  And as memory fades, the ill-documented resources need to be re-created, re-checked, reformatted.  Often, they are even hard to find on your internal server or laptop archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metadata is a hidden destroyer of the competitiveness of corporate or academic research, or independent content management.   It never quoted on external data vendor invoices, it is not planned as a cost item, because metadata, the description of a dataset, a document, a presentation, or song, is meaningless without the resource that it describes. You never buy metadata.  But if your dataset comes without proper metadata documentation, you are bound, like Sisyphus, to search for it, to re-arrange it, to check its currency units, its digits, its formatting.  Data analysts are reported to spend about 80% of their working hours on data processing and not data analysis &amp;ndash; partly, because data processing is a very laborious task that can be done by computers at a scale far cheaper, and partly because they do not know if the person who sat before them at the same desk has already performed these tasks, or if the person responsible for quality control checked for errors.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undocumented data is hardly informative – it may be a page in a book, a file in an obsolete file format on a governmental server, an Excel sheet that you do not remember to have checked for updates.  Most data are useless, because we do not know how it can inform us, or we do not know if we can trust it.  The processing can be a daunting task, not to mention the most boring and often neglected documentation duties after the dataset is final and pronounced error-free by the person in charge of quality control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;observatory-metadata-services&#34;&gt;Our observatory automatically processes and documents the data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news about documentation and data validation costs is that they can be shared.  If many users need GDP/capita data from all over the world in euros, then it is enough if only one entity, a data observatory, collects all GDP and population data expresed in dollars, korunas, and euros, and makes sure that the latest data is correctly translated to euros, and then correctly divided by the latest population figures. These task are error-prone,and should not be repeaeted by every data journalist, NGO employee, PhD student or junior analyst.  This is one of the services of our data observatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;input checked=&#34;&#34; disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; The tidy data format means that the data has a uniform and clear data structure and semantics, therefore it can be automatically validated for many common errors and can be automatically documented by either our software or any other professional data science application. It is not as strict as the schema for a relational database, but it is strict enough to make, among other things, importing into a database easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;input checked=&#34;&#34; disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; The descriptive metadata contains information on how to find the data, access the data, join it with other data (interoperability) and use it, and reuse it, even years from now. Among others, it contains file format information and intellectual property rights information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;input checked=&#34;&#34; disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; The processing metadata makes the data usable in strictly regulated professional environments, such as in public administration, law firms, investment consultancies, or in scientific research. We give you the entire processing history of the data, which makes peer-review or external audit much easier and cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;input checked=&#34;&#34; disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; The authoritative copy is held at an independent repository, it has a globally unique identifier that protects you from accidental data loss, mixing up with unfinished an untested version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While humans are much better at analysing the information and human agency is required for trustworthy AI, computers are much better at processing and documenting data.  We apply to important concepts to our data service: we always process the data to the tidy format, we create an authoritative copy, and we always automatically add descriptive and processing metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;value-of-metadata&#34;&gt;The value of metadata&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metadata is often more valuable and more costly to make than the data itself, yet it remains an elusive concept for senior or financial management.  Metadata is information about how to correctly use the data and has no value without the data itself.  Data acquisition, such as buying from a data vendor, or paying an opinion polling company, or external data consultants appears among the material costs, but metadata is never sold alone, and you do not see its cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases, the reason why &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-06-18-gold-without-rush/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;there is no gold rush for open data&lt;/a&gt; is that fact that while the EU member states release billions of euros&amp;rsquo; worth data for free, or at very low cost, annually, it comes without proper metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the data source is cheap or has a low quality, you do not even get it.  If you do not have it, it will show up as a human resource cost in research (when your analysist or junior researcher are spending countless hours to find out the missing metadata information on the correct use of the data) or in sales costs (when you try to reuse a research, consulting or legal product and you have comb through your archive and retest elements again and again.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adding metadata exponentially increases the value of data. Did your region add a new town to its boundaries? How do you adjust old data to conform to constantly changing geographic boundaries? What are some practical ways of combining satellite sensory data with my organization&amp;rsquo;s records? And do I have the right to do so? Metadata logs the history of data, providing instructions on how to reuse it, also setting the terms of use. We automate this labor-intensive process applying the FAIR data concept.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our observatory we apply the concept of &lt;a href=&#34;#FAIR&#34;&gt;FAIR&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;f&lt;/strong&gt;indable, &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;ccessibe, &lt;strong&gt;i&lt;/strong&gt;nteroperable, and &lt;strong&gt;r&lt;/strong&gt;eusable digital assets) in our APIs and in our open-source statistical software packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-hidden-cost-item&#34;&gt;The hidden cost item&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metadata gets less attention than data, because it is never acquired separately, it is not on the invoice, and therefore it remains an a hidden cost, and it is more important from a budgeting and a usability point of view than the data itself. Metadata is responsible for industry non-billable hours or uncredited working hours in academia. Poor data documentation, lack of reproducible processing and testing logs, inconsistent use of currencies, keywords, and storing &lt;a href=&#34;#messy-data&#34;&gt;messy data&lt;/a&gt; make reusability and interoperability, integration with other information impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#FAIR-data&#34;&gt;FAIR Data and the Added Value of Rich Metadata&lt;/a&gt; we introduce how we apply the concept of &lt;a href=&#34;#FAIR&#34;&gt;FAIR&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;f&lt;/strong&gt;indable, &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;ccessibe, &lt;strong&gt;i&lt;/strong&gt;nteroperable, and &lt;strong&gt;r&lt;/strong&gt;eusable digital assets) in our APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations pay many times for the same, repeated work, because these boring tasks, which often comprise of tens of thousands of microtasks, are neglected. Our solution creates automatic documentation and metadata for your own historical internal data or for acquisitions from data vendors. We apply the more general &lt;a href=&#34;#Dublin-Core&#34;&gt;Dublin Core&lt;/a&gt; and the more specific, mandatory and recommended values of &lt;a href=&#34;#DataCite&#34;&gt;DataCite&lt;/a&gt; for datasets &amp;ndash; these are new requirements in EU-funded research from 2021. But they are just the minimal steps, and there is a lot more to do to create a diamond ring from an uncut gem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;map-your-data-bibliographis-catalogues-codebooks-versioning&#34;&gt;Map your data: bibliographis, catalogues, codebooks, versioning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updating descriptive metadata, such as bibliographic citation files, descriptions and sources to data files downloaded from the internet, versioning spreadsheet documents and presentations is usually a hated and often neglected task withing organization, and rightly so: these boring and error-prone tasks are best left to computers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of time and resources spend on documentation over time reduces reusability and significantly increases data processing and supervision or auditing costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input checked=&#34;&#34; disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Our observatory metadata is compliant with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/cross-domain-attribute/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dublin Core Cross-Domain Attribute Set&lt;/a&gt; metadata standard, but we use different formatting. We offer simple re-formatting from the richer DataCite to Dublin Core for interoperability with a wider set of data sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input checked=&#34;&#34; disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; We use all &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-mandatory-properties&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;mandatory&lt;/a&gt; DataCite metadata fields, all the &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-recommended-and-optional-properties&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the recommended and optional&lt;/a&gt; ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input checked=&#34;&#34; disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; It complies with the tidy data principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words: very easy to import into your databases, or join with other databases, and the information is easy to find.  Corrections, updates can automatically managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-happened-with-the-data-before&#34;&gt;What happened with the data before?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input checked=&#34;&#34; disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; We are creating Codebooks that are following the SDMX statistical metadata codelists, and resemble the SMDX concepts used by international statistical agencies. (See more technical information &lt;a href=&#34;https://r.dataobservatory.eu/articles/codebook.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small organizations often cannot afford to have data engineers and data scientists on staff, and they employ analysts who work with Excel, OpenOffice, PowerBI, SPSS or Stata.  The problem with these applications is that they often require the user to manually adjust the data, with keyboard entries or mouse clicks.  Furthermore, they do not provide a precise logging of the data processing, manipulation history.
The manual data processing and manipulation is very error prone and makes the use of complex and high value resources, such as harmonized surveys or symmetric input-output tables, to name two important source we deal with, impossible to use.  The use of these high-value data sources often requires tens of thousands of data processing steps: no human can do it faultlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is even more problematic that simple applications for analysis do not provide a log of these manipulations’ steps: pulling over a column with the mouse, renaming a row, adding a zero to an empty cell. This makes senior supervisory oversight and external audit very costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data comes with full history: all changes are visible, and we even open the code or algorithm that processed the raw data.  Your analysts can still use their favourite spreadsheet or statistical software application, but they can start from a clean, tidy dataset, with all data wrangling, currency and unit conversion, imputation and other low-priority but important tasks done and logged.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Survey Harmonization</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/data/surveys/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2021 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/data/surveys/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We provide retrospecitve, &lt;em&gt;ex post&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;ex ante&lt;/em&gt; survey harmonization to our partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The aim of retrospective survey harmonization is to pool data from pre-existing surveys made with a similar methodology in different points in time and different countries or territories.  Ex post survey harmonization is in a way a passive form of pooling research funding because you can utilize information from surveying that were made on somebody else’s expense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
















&lt;figure  id=&#34;figure-the-arab-barometer-surveys-do-not-have-a-consolidated-codebook-but-our-retroharmonize-software-created-one-and-put-together-data-from-three-years-and-collected-in-many-countries-about-various-public-policy-issues&#34;&gt;

      The Arab Barometer surveys do not have a consolidated codebook, but our retroharmonize software created one, and put together data from three years and collected in many countries about various public policy issues.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The aim of ex ante survey harmonization is to maximize the value from future retrospective harmonization; in a way, it is an active form of pooling research funding, because you benefit from money spent on related open governmental and open science survey programs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Eurobarometer grew out of certain CEE member states’ need for comparable data about their music and audiovisual sectors. We commissioned surveys following ESSNet-Culture guidelines and combined our survey data with open access European microdata-level surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://regions.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;regions&lt;/a&gt; solves the problems caused by Europe’s shifting regional boundaries, which have undergone changes in several thousand places over the last twenty years, meaning  member states’ and Eurostat’s regional statistics are not comparable over more than two to three years. This software validates and, where possible, changes the regional coding from NUTS1999 until the not yet used NUTS2021, opening up vast, valuable, untapped data sources that can be used for longitudinal analysis or for panel analysis far more precise than what  national data alone would allow. It was originally designed in a research project at IVIR in the University of Amsterdam to understand the geographical dynamics of book piracy. Because of the needs this software fills, it had 700 users in the first month after publication. It is particularly useful to re-code old surveys, as regional boundaries are changing in each decade several hundred times in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Open Data - The New Gold Without the Rush</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-06-18-gold-without-rush/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2021 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-06-18-gold-without-rush/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If open data is the new gold, why even those who release fail to reuse it? We created an open collaboration of data curators and open-source developers to dig into novel open data sources and/or increase the usability of existing ones. We transform reproducible research software into research- as-service.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, the EU announces that billions and billions of data are now “open” again, but this is not gold. At least not in the form of nicely minted gold coins, but in gold dust and nuggets found in the muddy banks of chilly rivers. There is no rush for it, because panning out its value requires a lot of hours of hard work. Our goal is to automate this work to make open data usable at scale, even in trustworthy AI solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
















&lt;figure  id=&#34;figure-there-is-no-rush-for-it-because-panning-out-its-value-requires-a-lot-of-hours-of-hard-work-our-goal-is-to-automate-this-work-to-make-open-data-usable-at-scale-even-in-trustworthy-ai-solutions&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/media/img/slides/gold_panning_slide_notitle.png&#34; alt=&#34;There is no rush for it, because panning out its value requires a lot of hours of hard work.

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most open data is not public, it is not downloadable from the Internet – in the EU parlance, “open” only means a legal entitlement to get access to it. And even in the rare cases when data is open and public, often it is mired by data quality issues. We are working on the prototypes of a data-as-service and research-as-service built with open-source statistical software that taps into various and often neglected open data sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in the prototype phase in June and our intentions are to have a well-functioning service by the time of the conference, because we are working only with open-source software elements; our technological readiness level is already very high. The novelty of our process is that we are trying to further develop and integrate a few open-source technology items into technologically and financially sustainable data-as-service and even research-as-service solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/media/img/observatory_screenshots/observatory_collage_16x9_800.png&#34; alt=&#34;Our review of about 80 EU, UN and OECD data observatories reveals that most of them do not use these organizations&amp;#39;s open data - instead they use various, and often not well processed proprietary sources.&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are taking a new and modern approach to the &lt;code&gt;data observatory&lt;/code&gt; concept, and modernizing it with the application of 21st century data and metadata standards, the new results of reproducible research and data science. Various UN and OECD bodies, and particularly the European Union support or maintain more than 60 data observatories, or permanent data collection and dissemination points, but even these do not use these organizations and their members open data. We are building open-source data observatories, which run open-source statistical software that automatically processes and documents reusable public sector data (from public transport, meteorology, tax offices, taxpayer funded satellite systems, etc.) and reusable scientific data (from EU taxpayer funded research) into new, high quality statistical indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are building various open-source data collection tools in R and Python to bring up data from big data APIs and legally open, but not public, and not well served data sources. For example, we are working on capturing representative data from the Spotify API or creating harmonized datasets from the Eurobarometer and Afrobarometer survey programs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open data is usually not public; whatever is legally accessible is usually not ready to use for commercial or scientific purposes. In Europe, almost all taxpayer funded data is legally open for reuse, but it is usually stored in heterogeneous formats, processed into an original government or scientific need, and with various and low documentation standards. Our expert data curators are looking for new data sources that should be (re-) processed and re-documented to be usable for a wider community. We would like to introduce our service flow, which touches upon many important aspects of data scientist, data engineer and data curatorial work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We believe that even such generally trusted data sources as Eurostat often need to be reprocessed, because various legal and political constraints do not allow the common European statistical services to provide optimal quality data – for example, on the regional and city levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/authors/ropengov/&#34;&gt;rOpenGov&lt;/a&gt; and other partners, we are creating open-source statistical software in R to re-process these heterogenous and low-quality data into tidy statistical indicators to automatically validate and document it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are carefully documenting and releasing administrative, processing, and descriptive metadata, following international metadata standards, to make our data easy to find and easy to use for data analysts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are automatically creating depositions and authoritative copies marked with an individual digital object identifier (DOI) to maintain data integrity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are building simple databases and supporting APIs that release the data without restrictions, in a tidy format that is easy to join with other data, or easy to join into databases, together with standardized metadata.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We maintain observatory websites (see: &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Digital Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://greendeal.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Green Deal Data Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://economy.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Economy Data Observatory&lt;/a&gt;) where not only the data is available, but we provide tutorials and use cases to make it easier to use them. Our mission is to show a modern, 21st century reimagination of the data observatory concept developed and supported by the UN, EU and OECD, and we want to show that modern reproducible research and open data could make the existing 60 data observatories and the planned new ones grow faster into data ecosystems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working around the open collaboration concept, which is well-known in open source software development and reproducible science, but we try to make this agile project management methodology more inclusive, and include data curators, and various institutional partners into this approach. Based around our early-stage startup, Reprex, and the open-source developer community rOpenGov, we are working together with other developers, data scientists, and domain specific data experts in climate change and mitigation, antitrust and innovation policies, and various aspects of the music and film industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Digital Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; was brought to the UK policy debate on music streaming by the &lt;em&gt;Written evidence submitted by The state51 Music Group&lt;/em&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;Economics of music streaming review&lt;/em&gt; of the UK Parliaments&amp;rsquo; DCMS Committee&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music industry requires a permanent market monitoring facility to win fights in competition tribunals, because it is increasingly disputing revenues with the world’s biggest data owners. This was precisely the role of the former CEEMID&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; program, which was initiated by a group of collective management societies. Starting with three relatively data-poor countries, where data pooling allowed rightsholders to increase revenues, the CEEMID data collection program was extended in 2019 to 12 countries.The &lt;a href=&#34;https://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;final regional report&lt;/a&gt;, after the release of the detailed &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/publication/hungary_music_industry_2014/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/publication/slovak_music_industry_2019/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Slovak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/publication/private_copying_croatia_2019/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Croatian reports&lt;/a&gt; of CEEMID was sponsored by Consolidated Independent (of the &lt;em&gt;state51 music group&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEEMID was eventually to formed into the &lt;em&gt;Demo Music Observatory&lt;/em&gt; in 2020&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, following the planned structure of the  &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-16-european-music-observatory-feasibility/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;European Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, and validated in the world&amp;rsquo;s 2nd ranked university-backed incubator, the Yes!Delft AI+Blockchain Validation Lab. In 2021, under the final name &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Digital Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, it became open for any rightsholder or stakeholder organization or music research institute, and it is being launched with the help of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-03-04-jump-2021/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;JUMP European Music Market Accelerator Programme&lt;/a&gt; which is co-funded by the Creative Europe Programme of the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2020, we started investigating how the music observatory concept could be introduced in the UK, and how our data and analytical skills could be used in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://digit-research.org/research/related-projects/music-creators-earnings-in-the-streaming-era/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music Creators’ Earnings in the Streaming Era&lt;/a&gt; (in short: MCE) project, which is taking place paralell to the heated political debates around the DCMS inquiry. After the &lt;em&gt;state51 music group&lt;/em&gt; gave permission for the UK Intellectual Property Office to reuse the data that was originally published as the experimental &lt;a href=&#34;https://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/market.html#recmarket&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CEEMID-CI Streaming Volume and Revenue Indexes&lt;/a&gt;, we came to a cooperation agreement between the MCE Project and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Digital Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt;. We provided a detailed historical analysis and computer simulation for the MCE Project, and we will host all the data of the &lt;em&gt;Music Creators’ Earnings Report&lt;/em&gt; in our observatory, hopefully no later than early July 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started our cooperation with the two  principal investigators of the project, &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/author/prof-david-hesmondhalgh/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Prof David Hesmondhalgh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/author/hyojung-sun/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dr Hyojugn Sun&lt;/a&gt; back in April and will start releasing the findings and the data in July 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;justified-and-unjustified-differences-in-earnings&#34;&gt;Justified and Unjustified Differences in Earnings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stating that the greatest difference among rightsholders’ earnings is related to the popularity of their works and recorded fixations can appear banal and trivial. Yet, because many payout problems appear in the hard-to-describe long tail, understanding the &lt;em&gt;justified&lt;/em&gt; differences of rightsholder earnings is an important step towards identifying the &lt;em&gt;unjustified&lt;/em&gt; differences. It would be a breach of copyright law if less popular, or never played artists, would receive significantly more payment at the expense of popular artists from streaming providers. The earnings must reflect the difference in use and the economic value in use among rightsholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our analysis we quantify differences using the actual data of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/market.html#ceemid-ci-volume-indexes&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CEEMID-CI Streaming Indexes&lt;/a&gt;, created from hundreds of millions of data points, and computer simulations under realistic scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;justified-difference--changes-over-time&#34;&gt;Justified Difference &amp;amp; Changes Over Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the &lt;em&gt;justified&lt;/em&gt; differences we quantify four objective justifications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The variability of the domestic price of a stream over time&lt;/em&gt; shows a diminishing, but variable value of streams. Depending on the release date of a recording, and how quickly it builds up or loses the interest of the audience, the same number of streams can result in about 28% different earnings. In the period 2015-2019, later releases were facing diminishing revenues on streaming platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The variability of international market share&lt;/em&gt; and international streaming prices in &lt;em&gt;International Competitiveness&lt;/em&gt;. Compared to UK streaming prices, most international markets, particularly emerging markets, have a much greater variability of streaming prices. The variability of prices in advanced foreign markets such as Germany was similar to that of the British market, but in emerging markets and smaller advanced markets–such as the Netherlands–we measured a variability of around 50-80%. Artists who have a significant foreign presence, depending on their foreign market share, can experience 2-3 times greater differences in earnings than artists whose audience is predominantly British.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
















&lt;figure  id=&#34;figure-in-our-simulated-results-the-depreciation-of-the-gbp-shielded-the-internationally-competitive-rightsholders-from-a-significant-part-of-the-otherwise-negative-price-change-in-streaming-markets&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure&amp;nbsp;&#34; data-post=&#34;:&amp;nbsp;&#34; class=&#34;numbered&#34;&gt;
      In our simulated results, the depreciation of the GBP shielded the internationally competitive rightsholders from a significant part of the otherwise negative price change in streaming markets.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The variability of the exchange rate&lt;/em&gt; that is applied when translating foreign currency revenues to the British pound in &lt;em&gt;Exchange Rate Effects&lt;/em&gt;. Our &lt;a href=&#34;https://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/market.html#ceemid-ci-volume-indexes&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CEEMID-CI Streaming Indexes&lt;/a&gt; index covers the post-Brexit referendum period, when the British pound was generally depreciating against most currencies. This resulted in a GBP-denominated translation gain for artists with a foreign presence. We show that the variability of the GBP exchange rates can add &lt;em&gt;bigger justified differences&lt;/em&gt; among rightsholders’ earnings than the entire British price variation. The exchange rate movements are typically in the range of 30%, or at the level of the British domestic price variations in streaming prices. In our simulated results, this effect shielded the internationally competitive rightsholders from a significant part of the otherwise negative price change in foreign markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were also investigating the choice of &lt;em&gt;distribution model&lt;/em&gt;. , i.e., Both models, the currently used &lt;em&gt;pro-rata&lt;/em&gt; model and the &lt;em&gt;user-centric&lt;/em&gt; distribution, which has many proponents (and was introduced by SoundCloud in 2021), changes the earnings of artists. We think that both models represent a bad compromise, but they are legal, and a change of zero-sum distribution change could potentially increase the income of less popular and older artists at the expense of very popular and younger artists. More about this in our forthcoming report!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our understanding, there are some known and some hypothetical causes of &lt;em&gt;unjustified&lt;/em&gt; earning differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did not have systemic data on the &lt;em&gt;uncollected revenues&lt;/em&gt;–these are earnings that are legally made, but due to documentation, matching, processing, accounting, or other problems, the earnings are not paid. We could not even attempt to estimate this problem in the absence of relevant British empirical data. The problem is likely to be greater in the case of composers than in producer and performer revenues. In ideal cases, of course, the unclaimed royalty is near 0% of the earnings; it seems that on advanced markets the magnitude of this problem is in the single digits, and in emerging markets much greater, sometimes up to 50%. Royalty distribution is a costly business, and the smaller the revenue, the smaller the cost base to manage billions of transactions and related micropayments. We are working with a large group of eminent copyright researchers to understand this program better and provide regulatory solutions. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-05-16-recommendation-outcomes/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Recommendation Systems: What can Go Wrong with the Algorithm? - Effects on equitable remuneration, fair value, cultural and media policy goals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More analysis is required to understand how the algorithmic, highly autonomous recommendation systems of digital platforms such as Spotify, YouTube, Apple, and Deezer, among others, impact music rightsholders’ earnings. There are some empirical findings that suggest that such biases are present in various platforms, but due to the high complexity of recommendation systems, it is impossible to intuitively assign blame to pre-existing user biases, wrong training datasets, improper algorithm design, and other factors. We are working with our data curators, competition economist &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/author/peter-ormosi/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dr Peter Ormosi&lt;/a&gt;, antropologist and data scientist &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/author/botond-vitos/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dr Botond Vitos&lt;/a&gt; and musicologist &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/post/2021-06-08-introducing-dominika-semanakova/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dominika Semaňáková - We Want Machine Learning Algorithms to Learn More About Slovak Music&lt;/a&gt; to understand what can go wrong here (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-06-08-teach-learning-machines/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Trustworthy AI: Check Where the Machine Learning Algorithm is Learning From&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is always a hypothetical possibility that organizations with monopolistic power try to corner the market or make the playing field uneven. The music industry requires a permanent market monitoring facility to win fights in competition tribunals, because it is increasingly disputing revenues with the world’s biggest data owners. We are working with our data curators, competition economist &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/author/peter-ormosi/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dr Peter Ormosi&lt;/a&gt; and copyright lawyer &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/post/2021-06-02-data-curator-eszter-kabai/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;dr Eszter Kabai - New Indicators for Royalty Pricing and Music Antitrust&lt;/a&gt; to find potential traces of an uneven playing field (see: &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/publication/music_level_playing_field_2021/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music Streaming: Is It a Level Playing Field?&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solidarity&#34;&gt;Solidarity &amp;amp; Equitable Remuneration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Equitable remuneration&lt;/em&gt; is a legal concept which has an economic aspect. In international law, it simply means that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work. Within the context of international copyright law, it was introduced by the Rome Convention, and it means that equitable remuneration means the same payment for the same use, regardless of genre, gender or other unrelated characteristics of the rightsholder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the word equitable in everyday usage often implies some level of equality and solidarity, in the context of royalty payments, these terms should not be mixed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solidarity is present in many royalty payout schemes, but it is unrelated to the legal concept of equitable remuneration. Music earnings are very heavily skewed towards a small number of very successful composers, performers, and producers. The music streaming licensing model has little elements of solidarity, unlike some of the licensing models that it is replacing–particularly public performance licensing. However, in those cases, the solidarity element is decided by the rightsholders themselves, and not by external parties like radio broadcasters or streaming service providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called socio-cultural funds that provide assistance for artists in financial need must be managed by rightsholders, not others, and the current streaming model makes the organizations of such solidaristic action particularly difficult. Our data curator, &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/author/katie-long/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Katie Long&lt;/a&gt; is working on us to find metrics and measurement possibilities on solidarity among rightsolders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-size-of-the-pie-and-the-distribution-of-the-pie&#34;&gt;The Size of the Pie and the Distribution of the Pie&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current debate in the United Kingdom is often organized around the submission of the &lt;em&gt;#BrokenRecord&lt;/em&gt; campaign to the DCMS committee, which calls for a legal re-definition of equitable remuneration rights&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This idea is not unique to the United Kingdom, in various European jurisdictions, performers fought similar campaigns for legislation or went to court, sometimes successfully, for example, in Hungary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another hot redistribution topic is the choice between the so-called &lt;em&gt;pro-rata&lt;/em&gt; versus &lt;em&gt;user-centric&lt;/em&gt; distribution of streaming royalties. We think that both models represent a bad compromise, but they are legal, and a zero-sum distribution change could potentially increase the income of less popular and older artists at the expense of very popular and younger artists. We instead propose an alternative approach of &lt;em&gt;artist-centric distribution&lt;/em&gt; that could be potentially a win-win for all rightsholder groups; further elaboration of the concept lies outside the scope of this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mission with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Digital Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; is to help focus the policy debate with facts around the economics of music streaming. The legal concept &lt;em&gt;equitable remuneration&lt;/em&gt; is inseparable from the economic concept of &lt;em&gt;fair valuation&lt;/em&gt;, and music streaming earnings cannot be subject to a valid economic analysis without analyzing &lt;em&gt;the economics of music&lt;/em&gt;. Streaming services are competing with digital downloads, physical sales, and radio broadcasting; and the media streaming of YouTube and similar services is competing with music streaming, radio, and television broadcasting as well as retransmissions. It is a critically important to determine if in replacing earlier services and sales channels, the new streaming licensing model (a mix of the mechanical and public performance licensing) is also capable of replacing the revenues for all rightsholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current streaming licensing model in Europe is a mix of mechanical and public performance rights. Therefore, when we are talking about music streaming, we must compare the streaming sub-market with the digital downloads, physical sales and private copying markets (mechanical licensing), and with the radio, television, cable and satellite retransmission markets (public performance licensing.) Our experience outside the UK suggests that these replacement values are very low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been a very long-time user of Charlie Thomson’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/charlie86/spotifyr&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;spotifyr R package&lt;/a&gt;, which is probably the most used open-source music analytics software in the world.  It provides programmatic access to the Spotify Web API, which contains access to the former Echo Nest quantitative musicology engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an essential part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Digital Music Observatory’s&lt;/a&gt; streaming analysis and our &lt;a href=&#34;https://listenlocal.community/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; apps designed for our trustworthy AI experiments and independent artist services.  I am extremely proud to announce that after a very thorough modernization of the package’s exception handling, documentation, and code dependencies that I did in the last week, the package has passed again the peer-review standards and it is back on CRAN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package is an excellent starting to point for R newbies to try their hands on musicology analysis with a few keystrokes. And of course, it is an essential part of the research infrastructure of musicology worldwide in far more advanced applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trustworthy AI: Check Where the Machine Learning Algorithm is Learning From</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We do care what our children learn, but we do not care yet about what our robots learn from.  One key idea behind trustworthy AI is that you verify what data sources your machine learning algorithms can learn from.  As we have emphasised in our forthcoming academic paper and in our experiments, one key problem that goes wrong when you see too few small country artists, or too few womxn in the charts is that the big tech recommendation systems and other autonomous systems are learning from historically biased or patchy data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Traitors in a war used to be executed by firing squad, and it was a psychologically burdensome task for soldiers to have to shoot former comrades. When a 10-marksman squad fired 8 blank and 2 live ammunition, the traitor would be 100% dead, and the soldiers firing would walk away with a semblance of consolation in the fact they had an 80% chance of not having been the one that killed a former comrade. This is a textbook example of assigning responsibility and blame in systems. AI-driven systems such as the YouTube or Spotify recommendation systems, the shelf organization of Amazon books, or the workings of a stock photo agency come together through complex processes, and when they produce undesirable results, or, on the contrary, they improve life, it is difficult to assign blame or credit [..] If you do not see enough women on streaming charts, or if you think that the percentage of European films on your favorite streaming provider—or Slovak music on your music streaming service—is too low, you have to be able to distribute the blame in more precise terms than just saying “it’s the system” that is stacked up against women, small countries, or other groups. We need to be able to point the blame more precisely in order to effect change through economic incentives or legal constraints.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Popular video and music streaming recommendation systems have at least three major components based on machine learning. The problem is usually not that an algorithm is nasty and malicious; algorithms are often trained through “machine learning” techniques, and often, machines “learn” from biased, faulty, or low-quality information.

&lt;p&gt;These undesirable outcomes are sometimes illegal as they may go against non-discrimination or competition law. (See our ideas on what can go wrong &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/publication/music_level_playing_field_2021/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music Streaming: Is It a Level Playing Field?&lt;/a&gt;) They may undermine national or EU-level cultural policy goals, media regulation, child protection rules, and fundamental rights protection against discrimination without basis. They may make Slovak artists earn significantly less than American artists.&lt;/p&gt;

The need for further research on how these large systems affect various fundamental rights, consumer or competition rights, or cultural and media policy goals cannot be overstated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/data/api/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our observatory has a new data API which allows access to our daily refreshing open data. You can access the API via &lt;a href=&#34;http://api.economy.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;api.economy.dataobservatory.eu&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;apologies for the ugly, temporary subdomain masking!&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the data and the metadata are available as open data, without database use restrictions, under the &lt;a href=&#34;https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ODbL&lt;/a&gt; license. However, the metadata contents are not finalized yet. We are currently working on a solution that applies the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship&lt;/a&gt;, and fulfills the mandatory requirements of the Dublic Core metadata standards and at the same time the &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-mandatory-properties&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;mandatory requirements&lt;/a&gt;, and most of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-recommended-and-optional-properties&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;recommended requirements&lt;/a&gt; of DataCite. These changes will be effective before 1 July 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Competition Data Observatory&lt;/strong&gt; temporarily shares an API with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://economy.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Economy Data Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, which serves as an incubator for similar economy-oriented reproducible research resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;indicator-table&#34;&gt;Indicator table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator table contains the actual values, and the various estimated/imputed values of the indicator, clearly marking missing values, too.&lt;/p&gt;

      api.economy.dataobservatory.eu: indicator retrieval
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get the data in &lt;a href=&#34;http://52.4.54.69/database/indicator.csv?_size=max&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CSV&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://52.4.54.69/database/indicator.json&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;json&lt;/a&gt; format, or write SQL querries. (Tutorials in SQL, R, Python will be posted shortly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;description-table&#34;&gt;Description metadata table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;metadata-table&#34;&gt;Processing Metadata table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://52.4.54.69/database/metadata&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;metadata table&lt;/a&gt; contains various data processing information, such as the first and last actual observation of the indicator, the number of approximated, forecasted, backcasted values, last update at source and in our system, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;descriptive-metadata&#34;&gt;Descriptive Metadata&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Identifier&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;An unambiguous reference to the resource within a given context. (Dublin Core item), but several identifiders allowed, and we will use several of them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Creator&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;The main researchers involved in producing the data, or the authors of the publication, in priority order. To supply multiple creators, repeat this property. (Extends the Dublin Core with multiple authors, and legal persons, and adds affiliation data.)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Title&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;A name given to the resource. Extends Dublin Core with alternative title, subtitle, translated Title, and other title(s).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Publisher&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;The name of the entity that holds, archives, publishes prints, distributes, releases, issues, or produces the resource. This property will be used to formulate the citation, so consider the prominence of the role. For software, use Publisher for the code repository. (Dublin Core item.)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Publication Year&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;The year when the data was or will be made publicly available.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Resource Type&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;We publish Datasets, Images, Report, and Data Papers. (Dublin Core item with controlled vocabulary.)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;recommended-for-discovery&#34;&gt;Recommended for discovery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Recommended&lt;/strong&gt; (R) properties are optional, but strongly recommended for interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Subject&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;The topic of the resource. (Dublin Core item.)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Contributor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;The institution or person responsible for collecting, managing, distributing, or otherwise contributing to the development of the resource. (Extends the Dublin Core with multiple authors, and legal persons, and adds affiliation data.) When applicable, we add Distributor (of the datasets and images), Contact Person, Data Collector, Data Curator, Data Manager, Hosting Institution, Producer (for images), Project Manager, Researcher, Research Group, Rightsholder, Sponsor, Supervisor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Date&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;A point or period of time associated with an event in the lifecycle of the resource, besides the Dublin Core minimum we add Collected, Created, Issued, Updated, and if necessary, Withdrawn dates to our datasets.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Related Identifier&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;An identifier or identifiers other than the primary Identifier applied to the resource being registered.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Rights&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;We give &lt;a href=&#34;https://spdx.org/licenses/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SPDX License List&lt;/a&gt; standards rights description with URLs to the actual license. (Dublin Core item: Rights Management)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Recommended for discovery.(Dublin Core item.)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;GeoLocation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;Similar to Dublin Core item Coverage&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Subject&lt;/code&gt; property: we need to set standard coding schemas for each observatory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Contributor&lt;/code&gt; property:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;DataCurator&lt;/code&gt; the curator of the dataset, who sets the mandatory properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;DataManager&lt;/code&gt; the person who keeps the dataset up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ContactPerson&lt;/code&gt; the person who can be contacted for reuse requests or bug reports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Date&lt;/code&gt; property contains the following dates, which are set automatically by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://r.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;dataobservatory R package&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Updated&lt;/code&gt; when the dataset was updated;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;EarliestObservation&lt;/code&gt;, which the earliest, not backcasted, estimated or imputed observation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;LatestObservation&lt;/code&gt;, which the earliest, not backcasted, estimated or imputed observation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;UpdatedatSource&lt;/code&gt;, when the raw data source was last updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;GeoLocation&lt;/code&gt; is automatically created by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://r.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;dataobservatory R package&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Description&lt;/code&gt; property optional elements, and we adopted them as follows for the observatories:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Abstract&lt;/code&gt; is a short, textual description; we try to automate its creation as much as a possible, but some curatorial input is necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;TechnicalInfo&lt;/code&gt; sub-field, we record automatically the &lt;code&gt;utils::sessionInfo()&lt;/code&gt; for computational reproducability. This is automatically created by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://r.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;dataobservatory R package&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;Other&lt;/code&gt; sub-field, we record the keywords for structuring the observatory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;optional&#34;&gt;Optional&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Optional&lt;/strong&gt; (O) properties are optional and provide richer description. For findability they are not so important, but to create a web service, they are essential. In the mandatory and recommended fields, we are following other metadata standards and codelists, but in the optional fields we have to build up our own system for the observatories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Language&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;A language of the resource. (Dublin Core item.)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Alternative Identifier&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;An identifier or identifiers other than the primary Identifier applied to the resource being registered.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Size&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;We give the CSV, downloadable dataset size in bytes.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Format&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;We give file format information. We mainly use CSV and JSON, and occasionally rds and SPSS types. (Dublin Core item.)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Version&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;The version number of the resource.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Rights&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;We give &lt;a href=&#34;https://spdx.org/licenses/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SPDX License List&lt;/a&gt; standards rights description with URLs to the actual license. (Dublin Core item: Rights Management)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Funding Reference&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;We provide the funding reference information when applicable. This is usually mandatory with public funds.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Related Item&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;We give information about our observatory partners&amp;rsquo; related research products, awards, grants (also Dublin Core item as Relation.) We particularly include source information when the dataset is derived from another resource (which is a Dublin Core item.)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;Language&lt;/code&gt; we only use English (eng) at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By default We do not use the &lt;code&gt;Alternative Identifier&lt;/code&gt; property. We will do this when the same dataset will be used in several observatories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Size&lt;/code&gt; property is measured in bytes for the CSV representation of the dataset. During creations, the software creates a temporary CSV file to check if the dataset has no writing problems, and measures the dataset size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Version&lt;/code&gt; property needs further work. For a daily re-freshing API we need to find an applicable versioning system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Funding reference&lt;/code&gt; will contain information for donors, sponsors, and co-financing partners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our default setting for &lt;code&gt;Rights&lt;/code&gt; is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://spdx.org/licenses/CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0&lt;/a&gt; license and we provide an URI for the license document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;RelatedItem&lt;/code&gt; we give information about:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The original (raw) data source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methodological bibilography reference, when needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The open-source statistical software code that processed the data.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;administrative-metadata&#34;&gt;Administrative Metadata&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like with diamonds, it is better to know the history of a dataset, too. Our administrative metadata contains codelists that follow the SXDX statistical metadata standards, and similarly strucutred information about the processing history of the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reprex is Contesting all Three Challenges of the EU Datathon 2021 Prize</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-05-21-eu-datathon-2021/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-05-21-eu-datathon-2021/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reprex, a Dutch start-up enterprise formed to utilize open source software and open data, is looking for partners in an agile, open collaboration to win at least one of the three EU Datathon Prizes. We are looking for policy partners, academic partners and a consultancy partner. Our project is based on agile, open collaboration with three types of contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our competing prototypes we want to show that we have a research automation technology that can find open data, process it and validate it into high-quality business, policy or scientific indicators, and release it with daily refreshments in a modern API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for institutions to challenge us with their data problems, and sponsors to increase our capacity. Over then next 5 months, we need to find a sustainable business model for a high-quality and open alternative to other public data programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-eu-datathon-2021-challenge&#34;&gt;The EU Datathon 2021 Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To take part, you should propose the development of an application that links and uses open datasets.&lt;/em&gt; - our &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/#contributors&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;data curator team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your application &amp;hellip; is also expected to find suitable new approaches and solutions to help Europe achieve important goals set by the European Commission through the use of open data.&lt;/em&gt;” - this application is developed by our &lt;a href=&#34;https://greendeal.dataobservatory.eu/#contributors&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;technology contributors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your application should showcase opportunities for concrete business models or social enterprises.&lt;/em&gt; - our &lt;a href=&#34;https://economy.dataobservatory.eu/#contributors&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;service development team&lt;/a&gt; is working to make this happen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use open source software and open data. The applications are hosted on the cloud resources of &lt;a href=&#34;#reprex&#34;&gt;Reprex&lt;/a&gt;, an early-stage technology startup currently building a viable, open-source, Open data business model to create reproducible research products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working together with experts in the domain as curators (check out our guidelines if you want to join: &lt;a href=&#34;https://curators.dataobservatory.eu/data-curators.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Data Curators: Get Inspired!&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our development team works on an open collaboration basis. Our indicator R packages, and our services are developed together with &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/author/ropengov/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;rOpenGov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mission-statement&#34;&gt;Mission statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to win an &lt;a href=&#34;https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eudatathon&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;EU Datathon prize&lt;/a&gt; by processing the vast, already-available governmental and scientific open data made usable for policy-makers, scientific researchers, and business researcher end-users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change and environmental degradation are an existential threat to Europe and the world. To overcome these challenges, the European Union created the European Green Deal strategic plan, which aims to make the EU’s economy sustainable by turning climate and environmental challenges into opportunities and making the transition just and inclusive for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&#34;http://greendeal.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Green Deal Data Observatory&lt;/a&gt; is a modern reimagination of existing ‘data observatories’; currently, there are over 70 permanent international data collection and dissemination points. One of our objectives is to understand why the dozens of the EU’s observatories do not use open data and reproducible research. We want to show that open governmental data, open science, and reproducible research can lead to a higher quality and faster data ecosystem that fosters growth for policy, business, and academic data users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We provide high quality, tidy data through a modern API which enables data flows between public and proprietary databases. We believe that introducing Open Policy Analysis standards with open data, open-source software, and research automation, can help the Green Deal policymaking process. Our collaboration is open for individuals, citizens scientists, research institutes, NGOS, and companies.&lt;/p&gt;

Modernising our standards system, 2. Consolidating Europe’s intellectual property framework, and 3. Enabling the balanced development of the collaborative economy strategic goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big data and automation create new inequalities and injustices and have the potential to create a jobless growth economy. Our &lt;a href=&#34;https://economy.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Economy Data Observatory&lt;/a&gt; is a fully automated, open source, open data observatory that produces new indicators from open data sources and experimental big data sources, with authoritative copies and a modern API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our observatory monitors the European economy to protect consumers and small companies from unfair competition, both from data and knowledge monopolization and robotization. We take a critical Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SME)-, intellectual property, and competition policy point of view of automation, robotization, and the AI revolution on the service-oriented European social market economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to create early-warning, risk, economic effect, and impact indicators that can be used in scientific, business, and policy contexts for professionals who are working on re-setting the European economy after a devastating pandemic in the age of AI. We are particularly interested in designing indicators that can be early warnings for killer acquisitions, algorithmic and offline discrimination against consumers based on nationality or place of residence, and signs of undermining key economic and competition policy goals. Our goal is to help small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups to grow, and to furnish data that encourages the financial sector to provide loans and equity funds for their growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Digital Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; (DMO) is a fully automated, open source, open data observatory that creates public datasets to provide a comprehensive view of the European music industry. It provides high-quality and timely indicators in all four pillars of the planned official European Music Observatory as a modern, open source and largely open data-based, automated, API-supported alternative solution for this planned observatory. The insight and methodologies we are refining in the DMO are applicable and transferable to about 60 other data observatories funded by the EU which do not currently employ governmental or scientific open data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music is one of the most data-driven service industries where most sales are currently executed by AI-driven autonomous systems that influence market shares and intellectual property remuneration. We provide a template that enables making these AI-driven systems accountable and trustworthy, with the goal of re-balancing the legitimate interests of creators, distributors, and consumers. Within Europe, this new balance will be an important use case of the European Data Strategy and the Digital Services Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DMO is a fully functional service that can serve as a testing ground of the European Data Strategy. It can showcase the ways in which the music industry is affected by the problems that the Digital Services Act and European Trustworthy AI initiatives attempt to regulate. It is being built in open collaboration with national music stakeholders, NGOs, academic institutions, and industry groups.&lt;/p&gt;

We are currently developing this project with the help of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jumpmusic.eu/fellow2021/automated-music-observatory/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;JUMP European Music Market Accelerator&lt;/a&gt; program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-statement&#34;&gt;Problem Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU has an 18-year-old open data regime and it makes public taxpayer-funded data in the values of tens of billions of euros per year; the Eurostat program alone handles 20,000 international data products, including at least 5,000 pan-European environmental indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As open science principles gain increased acceptance, scientific researchers are making hundreds of thousands of valuable datasets public and available for replication every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU, the OECD, and UN institutions run around 100 data collection programs, so-called ‘data observatories’ that more or less avoid touching this data, and buy proprietary data instead. Annually, each observatory spends between 50 thousand and 3 million EUR on collecting untidy and proprietary data of inconsistent quality, while never even considering open data.&lt;/p&gt;

      Our automated data observatories are modern reimaginations of the existing observatories that do not use open data and research automation.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with the current EU data strategy is that while it produces enormous quantities of valuable open data, in the absence of common basic data science and documentation principles, it seems often cheaper to create new data than to put the existing open data into shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an absolute waste of resources and efforts. With a few R packages and our deep understanding of advanced data science techniques, we can create valuable datasets from unprocessed open data. In most domains, we are able to repurpose data originally created for other purposes at a historical cost of several billions of euros, converting these unused data assets into valuable datasets that can replace tens of millions’ worth of proprietary data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we want to achieve with this project – and we believe such an accomplishment would merit one of the first prizes - is to add value to a significant portion of pre-existing EU open data (for example, available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://data.europa.eu/data/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;data.europa.eu/data&lt;/a&gt;) by re-processing and integrating them into a modern, tidy database with an API access, and to find a business model that emphasises a triangular use of data in 1. business, 2. science and 3. policy-making. Our mission is to modernize the concept of &lt;code&gt;data observatories.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many countries in the world allow access to a vast array of information,
such as documents under freedom of information requests, statistics,
datasets. In the European Union, most taxpayer financed data in
government administration, transport, or meteorology, for example, can
be usually re-used. More and more scientific output is expected to be
reviewable and reproducible, which implies open access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;open-data-problems&#34;&gt;What’s the Problem with Open Data?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Data is stuff. It is raw, unprocessed, possibly even untouched by human
hands, unviewed by human eyes, un-thought-about by human minds.”&lt;/em&gt; [1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most open data cannot be just &lt;a href=&#34;#open-data-faq&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;downloaded.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often, you need to put more than $100 value of &lt;a href=&#34;#is-there-value-left-in-open-data&#34;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; into processing, validating, documenting a dataset that is worth $100. But you can share this investment with our data observatories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open data is almost always lacking of documentation, and no clear references to validate if the data is reliable or not corrupted. This is why we always &lt;a href=&#34;#open-data-value-added&#34;&gt;start&lt;/a&gt; with reprocessing and redocumenting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Rush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;open-data-value-added&#34;&gt;How We Add Value?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We believe that even such generally trusted data sources as Eurostat
often need to be reprocessed, because various legal and political
constraints do not allow the common European statistical services to
provide optimal quality data – for example, on the regional and city
levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With
&lt;a href=&#34;https://greendeal.dataobservatory.eu/authors/ropengov/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;rOpenGov&lt;/a&gt;
and other partners, we are creating open-source statistical software
in R to re-process these heterogenous and low-quality data into tidy
statistical indicators to automatically validate and document it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metadata is a potentially informative data record about a
potentially informative dataset. We are carefully documenting and
releasing administrative, processing, and descriptive metadata,
following international metadata standards, to make our data easy to
find and easy to use for data analysts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are automatically creating depositions and authoritative copies
marked with an individual digital object identifier (DOI) to
maintain data integrity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-there-value-left-in-open-data&#34;&gt;Is There Value in Open Data?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A well-known story tells of a finance professor and a student who come across a $100 bill lying on the ground. As the student stops to pick it up, the professor says, “Don’t bother—if it were really a $100 bill, it wouldn’t be there.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is not the case with open data.  Often, you need to put more than $100 into processing, validating, documenting a dataset that is worth $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the EU, open data is governed by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1561563110433&amp;amp;uri=CELEX:32019L1024&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Directive on open data and the re-use of public sector information - in short: Open Data Directive (EU) 2019 / 1024&lt;/a&gt;. It entered into force on 16 July 2019. It replaces the &lt;a href=&#34;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32003L0098&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Public Sector Information Directive&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the &lt;em&gt;PSI Directive&lt;/em&gt; which dated from 2003 and was subsequently amended in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Data&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;em&gt;potentially&lt;/em&gt; useful data that can &lt;em&gt;potentially&lt;/em&gt; replace costlier or hard to get data sources to build information. It is analogous to potential energy: work is required to release it. We build automated systems that reduce this work and increase the likelihood that open data will offer the &lt;em&gt;best value for money&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most open data is not publicy accessible, and available upon request. Our real curatorial advantage is that we know where it is and how to get this request processed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most European open data comes from tax authorities, meteorological
offices, managers of transport infrastructure, and other
governmental bodies whose data needs are very different from yours.
Their data must be carefully evaluated, re-processed, and if
necessary, imputed to be usable for your scientific, business or
policy goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The use of open science data is problematic in different ways:
usually understanding the data documentation requires
domain-specific specialist knowledge. &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/data/open-science/&#34;&gt;Open science
data&lt;/a&gt; is even more scattered and difficult to
access than technically open, but not public governmental data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-integration&#34;&gt;From Datasets to Data Integration, Data to Information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Data is only potential information, raw and unprocessed, prior to
anyone actually being informed by it.” ^[2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are building simple databases and supporting APIs that release
the data without restrictions, in a tidy format that is easy to join
with other data, or easy to join into databases, together with
standardized metadata.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-downloading-does-not-work&#34;&gt;Why Downloading Does Not Work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most open data is not available on the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is available, it is not in a form that you can easily import into a spreadsheet application like Excel or OpenOffice, or into a statistical application like SPSS or STATA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even the data quality of trusted web sources, like the Eurostat website, can be very low. Eurostat just publishes what it gets from governments, and often has no mandate to fix errors.  The data is full with missing information, and in the case of regional statistics, faulty region codes and region names that make matching your data or placing them on a map impossible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjusting euros with millions of euros, correctly translating dollars to euros, pounds to kilograms requires plenty of work. This is a very error-prone process when done by humans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;can-open-data-be-used-in-machine-learning-and-ai&#34;&gt;Can Open Data be Used in Machine Learning and AI?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most public and open data sources have many missing observations; machine learning models usually cannot hanlde missingness. These points must be carefully imputed with approximations, which can be very challenging when the data has geographical dimension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removing missing values makes samples extremely biased and your model will learn from omissions, not information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Traitors in a war used to be executed by firing squad, and it was a psychologically burdensome task for soldiers to have to shoot former comrades. When a 10-marksman squad fired 8 blank and 2 live ammunition, the traitor would be 100% dead, and the soldiers firing would walk away with a semblance of consolation in the fact they had an 80% chance of not having been the one that killed a former comrade. This is a textbook example of assigning responsibility and blame in systems. AI-driven systems such as the YouTube or Spotify recommendation systems, the shelf organization of Amazon books, or the workings of a stock photo agency come together through complex processes, and when they produce undesirable results, or, on the contrary, they improve life, it is difficult to assign blame or credit.&lt;/p&gt;

      Assigning and avoding blame.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do not see enough women on streaming charts, or if you think that the percentage of European films on your favorite streaming provider—or Slovak music on your music streaming service—is too low, you have to be able to distribute the blame in more precise terms than just saying “it’s the system” that is stacked up against women, small countries, or other groups. We need to be able to point the blame more precisely in order to effect change through economic incentives or legal constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is precisely the type of work we are doing with the continued support of the Slovak national rightsholder organizations, as well as in our research in the United Kingdom. We try to understand why classical musicians are paid less, or why 15% of Slovak, Estonian, Dutch, and Hungarian artists never appear on anybody’s personalized recommendations. We need to understand how various AI-driven systems operate, and one approach would at the very least model and assign blame for undesirable outcomes in probabilistic terms. The problem is usually not that an algorithm is nasty and malicious; algorithms are often trained through “machine learning” techniques, and often, machines “learn” from biased, faulty, or low-quality information.&lt;/p&gt;

      Outcomes: What Can Go Wrong With a Recommendation System?
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In complex systems there are hardly ever singular causes that explain undesired outcomes; in the case of algorithmic bias in music streaming, there is no single bullet that eliminates women from charts or makes Slovak or Estonian language content less valuable than that in English. Some apparent causes may in fact be “blank cartridges,” and the real fire might come from unexpected directions. Systematic, robust approaches are needed in order to understand what it is that may be working against female or non-cisgender artists, long-tail works, or small-country repertoires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of “undesirable outcomes” in recommendation engines might include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommending too small a proportion of female or small country artists; or recommending artists that promote hate and violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Placing Slovak books on lower shelves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making the works of major labels easier to find than those of independent labels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Placing a lower number of European works on your favorite video or music streaming platform’s start window than local television or radio regulations would require.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filling up your social media newsfeed with fake news about covid-19 spread by some malevolent agents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These undesirable outcomes are sometimes illegal as they may go against non-discrimination or competition law. (See our ideas on what can go wrong &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/publication/music_level_playing_field_2021/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music Streaming: Is It a Level Playing Field?&lt;/a&gt;) They may undermine national or EU-level cultural policy goals, media regulation, child protection rules, and fundamental rights protection against discrimination without basis. They may make Slovak artists earn significantly less than American artists.&lt;/p&gt;

      Metadata problems: no single bullet theory
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/publication/listen_local_2020/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;work in Slovakia&lt;/a&gt;, we reverse engineered some of these undesirable outcomes. Popular video and music streaming recommendation systems have at least three major components based on machine learning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The users’ history – Is it that users’ history is sexist, or perhaps the training metadata database is skewed against women?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The works’ characteristics – are Dvorak’s works as well documented for the algorithm as Taylor Swift’s or Drake’s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent information from the internet – Does the internet write less about women artists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the making of a recommendation or an autonomous playlist, these sources of information can be seen as “metadata” concerning a copyright-protected work (as well as its right-protected recorded fixation.) More often than not, we are not facing a malicious algorithm when we see undesirable system outcomes. The usual problem is that the algorithm is learning from data that is historically biased against women or biased for British and American artists, or that it is only able to find data in English language film and music reviews.
Metadata plays an incredibly important role in supporting or undermining general music education, media policy, copyright policy, or competition rules. If a video or music steaming platform’s algorithm is unaware of the music that music educators find suitable for Slovak or Estonian teenagers, then it will not recommend that music to your child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, metadata is very costly. In the case of cultural heritage, European states and the EU itself have been traditionally investing in metadata with each technological innovation. For Dvorak’s or Beethoven’s works, various library descriptions were made in the analogue world, then work and recording identifiers were assigned to CDs and mp3s, and eventually we must describe them again in a way intelligible for contemporary autonomous systems. In the case of classical music and literature, early cinema, or reproductions of artworks, we have public funding schemes for this work.  But this seems not to be enough. In the current economy of streaming, the increasingly low income generated by  most European works is insufficient to even cover the cost of proper documentation, which then sends that part of the European repertoire into a self-fulfilling oblivion: the algorithm cannot “learn” its properties and it never shows these works to users and audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, in most cases, it was assumed that it is the artists or their representative’s duty to provide high quality metadata, but in the analogue era, or in the era of individual digital copies, we did not anticipate that the sales value will not even cover the documentation cost. We must find technical solutions with interoperability and new economic incentives to create proper metadata for Europe’s cultural products. With that, we can cover one area out of the three possible problem terrains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is not enough. We need to address the question of how new, better algorithms can learn from user history and avoid amplifying pre-existing bias against women or hateful speech. We need to make sure that when algorithms are “scraping” the internet, they do so in an accountable way that does not make small language repertoires vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

The need for further research on how these large systems affect various fundamental rights, consumer or competition rights, or cultural and media policy goals cannot be overstated. The first step is to open and understand these autonomous systems. It is not enough to say that the firing squads of Big Tech are shooting women out from charts, ethnic minority artists from screens, and small language authors from the virtual bookshelves. We must put a lot more effort on researching the sources of the problems that make machine learning algorithms behave in a way that is not compatible with our European values or regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Upgrading the Slovak Music Database: New Data API, New Features</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-04-27-smdb/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2021 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-04-27-smdb/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We use the database to monitor market developments in streaming and radio services, and to detect any problems that may lead to a disadvantageous position for Slovak artists.  We are constantly monitoring if Slovak artists, regardless of their age, genre, gender, or ethnicity enjoy equal opportunity on streaming and radio platforms, and we are devising ways to increase their visibility and earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SMDB database has opt-in, opt-out features, and a write-in process, where Slovak musicologists determine if an artist should be written into the database.  The database uses data only from public data sources, and any artists who do not feel Slovak, or do not agree with our approach, can be removed at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Demo Music Database was created with the support of the Slovak Arts Council and Consolidated Independent, and in partnership and support with SOZA in 2020.  We are seeking new users and donors to make this database comprehensive and help all artists who feel Slovak to be heard at home and abroad.  With the help of volunteers and Reprex’s own resources, we have added some new features to the database in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our database in its early demo form analysed only the Spotify presence of artists.  We have added &lt;a href=&#34;http://3.221.117.58/listen-local/youtube-librarian&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; fully to the database, thanks to the work of our new team member, &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Botond Vitos, PhD&lt;/a&gt;. We have also started to integrate his &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-04-14-bandcamp-librarian-2/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bandcamp analyzer tool&lt;/a&gt; with our &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.shinyapps.io/listen-local-app/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local App&lt;/a&gt;. Soon we will be able to help on all three platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created a modern API to access the database for researchers, labels, and representative music organizations. The API works with standard SQL queries (see full documentation &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/getting_started.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), but also allows intuitive filters for manual use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, our &lt;a href=&#34;https://listenlocal.community/publication/listen_local_2020/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Feasibility Study&lt;/a&gt; contains a small case study with The Youniverse, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-30-youniverse/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tammy Nižňanska&lt;/a&gt; gave us an interview to form our ideas, together with &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-25-katarzia/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Katarzia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our database is not just a toy.  We have teamed up with the Slovak research institutes to understand how to best analyze and present the Slovak repertoire to the wider world.  We are developing an open-source system that recommends a predefined percentage of Slovak music to any user on Spotify.  We are giving marketing advice to artists like the Youniverse to pitch radios and tour destinations.  We try to identify who is likely to not receive payments from YouTube due to documentation problems. And we try to figure out why 15% of the artists seem to be never recommended &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-17-recommendation-analysis/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;on Spotify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Working With Localities and Location Tags</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/data-lyrics/how-to-speak-about-music-in-the-digital-age-from-taxonomies-to-folksonomies-ac2d25ed29f7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;previous blogpost &lt;/a&gt; addressed two ways of classifying music in the digital age: on the one hand, subgenre taxonomies proposed by industry vendors; on the other hand, user-defined collaborative tagging systems or folksonomies, which are more suitable for exploring niche music genres and to delve into the intricacies of an ever-evolving musical landscape. The Bandcamp Dance Librarian project takes into account both classification systems, using the taxonomy of industry vendor Beatport to detect stylistic tendencies or repertoires within the Bandcamp libraries of grassroots electronic dance music labels. This is performed by identifying clusters within a Bandcamp library based on Beatport’s subgenre labels. For instance, a cluster from the library of &lt;em&gt;Samurai Music&lt;/em&gt; is identifed as an amalgam of &lt;code&gt;Drum&amp;amp;Bass&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Leftfield Bass&lt;/code&gt;, and to a lesser extent &lt;code&gt;Trap-Hip-Hop-R&amp;amp;B&lt;/code&gt;. The dimension of this cluster (i.e., the number of tracks) is then displayed on a timeline among other clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bandcamp is a reputable publishing platform aimed towards independent musicians that encourages the use of tags (folksonomies) by its users — accordingly, the Librarian takes into account the artist/label tags added to the Bandcamp pages. It is therefore possible to compare the industry taxonomy of Beatport with artist folksonomies, as long as such tags are provided on Bandcamp or further investigation around particular folksonomies is performed. For instance, a representative track from the cluster identified above is described, among others, as &lt;em&gt;homemade weaponry&lt;/em&gt; by the eponymous artist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few more (technical) details about the project: The classifier is based on the methodology of Caparrini et al. (2020), using 92 audio features extracted from electronic dance music tracks within Beatport’s Top-100 lists in various subgenres. Bandcamp offers freely available full-length (low-bitrate) streams as track previews, which are suitable for musical feature extraction and analysis. Complete Bandcamp libraries are processed, and each track’s class (subgenre) probabilities are determined by the classifier, which forms the basis for the clustering algorithm. The number of clusters can be set in advance or calculated automatically. Results are provided in a PDF file with links to up to three representative Bandcamp tracks (if possible, from different artists) in each group and their attached tags (folksonomies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remainder of this post presents two use cases focused on localities and location tags (signifying cities, countries and sometimes nationalities). Such tags help putting local music scenes on the map; in the case of particularly prolific or creative cities they can be connected to specific genres too. Most commonly, they identify the city or country where the music label or the artist is based. Electronic music production requires relatively accessible tools and is usually carried out entirely by the producer; prominent artists are often running record labels that are integral to promoting music and structuring scenes. These aspects contribute to the burgeoning of independent music communities across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first example draws on features extracted from 36 Bandcamp label libraries. The libraries are taken from a piece of music journalism (&lt;a href=&#34;https://cdm.link/2020/05/underground-techno-labels-a-bandcamp-guide/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://cdm.link/2020/05/underground-techno-labels-a-bandcamp-guide/&lt;/a&gt;) addressing some of Bandcamp’s “underground” techno labels that “have a sense of community, even [as] a small collective of a few friends unlikely to catch larger attention”. Such specialist music press is characterized by Canadian sociologist Sarah Thorton as &lt;em&gt;niche media&lt;/em&gt;, which is particularly efficient in categorizing social groups, classifying sounds, defining cultural distinctions and baptizing genres. The list of labels offered in the CDM article is suitable for our current aim: a blink into the sound of “underground” techno labels based on their Bandcamp location tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collection includes 14.200 tracks analyzed by the Librarian. A total of 97.334 tags are attached to the tracks, as illustrated by the word cloud below:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Note: United Kingdom has been conflated with London for the purposes of this illustration.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one way or another, the relative relevance of these cities within the global techno circuit can be inferred from these numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By instructing the Librarian to treat as a single cluster all tracks that are tagged with the same city label, an attempt can be made to delineate an overall — although not the only — sound that can be comfortably identified with a location. &lt;em&gt;Berlin&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, can be classified as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, defining a single cluster will not account for the sonic variety of such influential cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, the detected subgenres are concentrated on the various flavours of techno. For more stylistic variety, we can use the Librarian with different music styles and datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;slovakia-case-study&#34;&gt;Slovakia Case Study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following example concerns artists that are somehow appear to be connected with Slovakia. Our goal was to focus on Slovakian artists on Spotify that have Bandcamp presence too, and use the Librarian as support for the recommendations. A sample of 82 such artists was selected; their Bandcamp libraries included 2379 tracks. In total, 17.881 tags were attached to these tracks, among which 550 were unique. The tag frequencies are illustrated below:&lt;/p&gt;

      Tag Frequencies
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the word cloud also suggests, the tracks cover a variety of genres. Accordingly, our classifier should be more general in scope than in the case of the techno labels. A suitable option is the MSD-MusiCNN TensorFlow auto-tagging model supplied with the  &lt;a href=&#34;https://mtg.github.io/essentia-labs/news/tensorflow/2020/01/16/tensorflow-models-released/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Essentia library&lt;/a&gt;, which predicts LastFm’s top-50 music classification tags (a selection of 24 tags referring to music genres or styles were predicted for the purposes of this demonstration).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can get a first feel of the stylistic tendencies within the sample by looking at the classification tags with the highest mean probability values:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rock 0.169777&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hip-Hop 0.141943&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;electronic 0.136527&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;alternative 0.079971&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pop 0.066009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, the five most representative genres or styles in our collection are rock, hip-hop, electronic, alternative and pop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more refined perspective is gained after clustering the tracks based on their tag probability values. The algorithm proposes three clusters by default, crystallized around the &lt;code&gt;rock (alternative/pop)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;hip-hop&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;electronic (ambient/dance)&lt;/code&gt; genres:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track examples provide the closest matches with the identified subgenres, and the complete clusters are not restricted to these styles. However, by increasing the cluster number it is possible to further refine the results. By increasing it to five groups, for example, a &lt;code&gt;rock/electronic/pop fusion&lt;/code&gt; group is also identified, and &lt;code&gt;metal&lt;/code&gt; appears as a new determining genre:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A New Streaming Model Built by Avant-Garde Improvisers</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-04-09-avantgarde-improvisers/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-04-09-avantgarde-improvisers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Andy Crush on Pitchfork recently wrote about Catalytic Sound (&lt;a href=&#34;https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/meet-the-experimental-musicians-who-built-their-own-streaming-service/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Meet the Experimental Musicians Who Built Their Own Streaming Service&lt;/a&gt;), a collaborative platform in which experimental musicians built their own streaming service out of dissatisfaction with the status quo in digital audio streaming and the music industry, more in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic Sound, a cooperative organization comprising 30 avant-garde instrumentalists and composers, is attempting to actualize this dream — and hoping to help other similarly minded musicians do the same for themselves. In January, the co-op’s partners launched Catalytic Soundstream, a small-scale streaming platform that charges listeners $10 per month for access to a rotating library of albums from the fringes of improvised music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing as a member of Reprex, a startup that brings together the sensibilities of musicians, data scientists, ethnomusicologists, and policy scholars, I find this important initiative — in an arts and entertainment context increasingly dominated by a few large companies — inspiring, if not plain heartwarming. Here are but a few of the many reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– The impulse behind Catalytic Sound reveals something at the interface between practical and poignant about current times. The ever-growing platform economy — in which platforms are not only facilitating interactions and transactions between producers and consumers, but also becoming producers in their own right (think Netflix and Amazon making their own films and series, Spotify circumventing record labels and signing its own artists and creating its own genres) — is cornering global markets. From the point of view of listeners or viewers, options are constrained according to which platform: you can access only what you have subscribed for, and within that selection, certain recommendations are pushed to the detriment of others. Moreover, the options you are exposed to increasingly converge around the ideals of the platform owner. From the point of view of artists and media producers, being findable on certain platforms becomes essential, and this often means conforming to platform-imposed agendas and aesthetics, as Liz Pelly astutely explores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– The story behind Catalytic Sound reminds us that there are alternatives. Our &lt;a href=&#34;https://listenlocal.community/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; project shares a similar ethos: we believe that there must be better options and we take action because we realize that these alternatives will not materialize unless ideas and forms of collaboration come from new places and unconventional pools of talent. Reprex was born out of dreams similar to those expressed in Cush’s article: “What if we got together and built an alternative platform that prioritized the needs of independent musicians? What if we made the rules about who gets paid, and how?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Catalytic Sound underlines the importance of openness: As Andy Cush narrates, the Catalytic Sound project started with tweets by Nipsey Hussle, in which the the late Los Angeles rapper shared how much money one million streams translated to in different streaming platforms (around &lt;code&gt;$12,500&lt;/code&gt; in Tidal and &lt;code&gt;$4,000&lt;/code&gt; in Spotify and Amazon Music). Having a sense of these numbers led to some serious coming to terms with how little musicians make through streaming, and the need to look for an alternative, no matter how modest. It’s a matter of principle: “Catalytic isn’t making any of its partners rich, but then again, neither is Spotify. (Even the $46 the musicians received at minimum last month adds up to a bigger yearly check than plenty of artists see from corporate streaming.)” At Reprex, we prioritize open data and open source collaboration as a way to build bridges between businesses, policy-makers, and academia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the model Catalytic Sound is proposing is one about collaboration in which similar grassroots organizations share knowledge and work towards common goals. So far, in our Listen Local initiative, we have focused on the ways in which independent and marginalized artists can find their way on existing streaming platforms, and how listeners find locally relevant artists instead of being taken to the playlists of international superstars. Catalytic Sounds opens a new perspective— starting a new streaming service as a way of participating in that larger historical project of dismantling, rethinking, and creating, recalling what a certain Audre Lorde had to say about undoing the master’s house  &lt;a href=&#34;https://collectiveliberation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Lorde_The_Masters_Tools.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Willemijn graduated from art academy ArtEZ in Enschede in 2011. At her final exhibition she was one of ten talented upcoming artists across the graduates of the three ArtEZ art academies selected to show their work at Oostenwind 11 in the Delta Lloyd building in Amsterdam. She moved to Antwerp to work in solitude and to find her creative environment. Besides making her own art, Willemijn also works as a painter on commission, as a production manager at Picoux Productions, and has been a vocalist and cellist with Verlin. She is looking for both audiences and collaborators.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our initiative, Listen Local, is trying to connect local audiences with locally relevant musicians. Where do you feel at home as a musician?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling at home for me is not linked to a place, feeling at home for me has to do with connecting with people. That’s also what art is about, right? Touching people with what you do or make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true, though, that I feel at home in Antwerp; I did from the moment I stepped out of the train the first time I came here. There’s something about the atmosphere here, it’s sort of laissez-faire — or at least it felt that way nine years ago. It’s the reason why I wanted to live here, even though I didn’t know anyone here. The second time ever that I came to Antwerp was to move my belongings from the Netherlands to my Antwerp apartment. It was freedom, it was following my heart: on my own in a city and country I didn’t really know, choosing art above everything.&lt;/p&gt;

      Willemijn de Krey: Sixteen and Beautiful
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the morning of my sixteenth birthday. The first time I slept on the campsite of a music festival. Lowlands with my best friend. I hate camping, but I love music! Still glad someone found it worth it to capture this moment: “It’s your birthday!” #flash We’re eating bread with ‘schuddebuikjes’ here. In other words, “bread with minuscule cookies.” She’s wearing her skeleton hoodie and I’m wearing my Nirvana hoodie. The day before, when I was still 15, I saw PJ Harvey perform. Bless her. And bless how beautiful my friend and I were then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…But yeah, where do I feel at home as a musician? It’s got to do with the connection on stage and bringing it out there. It’s got to do with sincerity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If people from other places would visit Antwerp, what would you recommend them to see, hear or try out? Can you recommend some local music or places?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Antwerp I like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oltrivierenhof.be/nl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Openluchttheater Rivierenhof&lt;/a&gt; very much. I saw Patti Smith perform there, which was kind of magical. It’s this stage in the middle of a huge park. People can sit in a semi-circle on benches or stand in front of the stage. It creates a really nice ambience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I discovered Matt Watts’s music. At the moment he’s working on a new album with Stef Kamil Carlens as producer. The first single got released in February. And he also has another project with Nicolas Rombauts. So there are two albums of his coming out this year that I do believe are worthy of people’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed?uri=spotify%3Aartist%3A0AGWpc8nl5NQNkvsz75rkF&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;433&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music performers and DJs usually start out at small local clubs and stages, and they are often constrained by the logistics of live performance. Is there any difference in building your audience as a painter? Is it important to be part of a local scene in art?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think pretty much everything starts from where you are located, so yes, local is the logical first step. Last July I had an exhibition in a place here in Antwerp called &lt;a href=&#34;https://whosafraid.be/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Who’s Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue&lt;/a&gt;. The owner gives courses in art, people can drink and eat something there and she has a space where every month other artists can show their work.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is that in art you have to get introduced to galleries and such by someone who has a connection with the gallery owner. Someone has to say, Hey, I think you might be interested in seeing the work of this artist, rather than going somewhere and saying, Hey, I’m an artist, want to look at my work? It also doesn’t feel right to present yourself like that, or at least for me it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this day and age it seems that everyone has to be their own businessman/woman, but in my opinion that’s somewhat ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think people who have a lot of connections have a huge advantage in getting somewhere. Networking is important, but again, not everyone is good at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are not a businesswoman, as you say, but how do you get commissions for your paintings?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People approach me. Oftentimes they want to see a certain photo painted by me. It also happened that I got a commission from a friend of someone who had bought ink drawings from me. This person gave me a phrase, “men of words,” and from there I created this ink drawing in complete freedom. It was a very nice thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You painted the cover art for your own band. Have you worked with other bands as a painter, creative designer, makeup artist or in another, non-musician role?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did several artworks for Verlin. I haven’t done anything for other bands yet, but I would love to. Ever since I was young I’ve had a fascination for album covers. I could sit for hours in front of my parents’ record collection and look at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there any location in particular where you would like to make music or find an audience for your music and your paintings?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there are many places where I would like to make music and exhibit my paintings and drawings. It’s always a wonderful feeling when a work you made finds a new home to live in. In my mind I know what I want. Again it has got to do with this connection with the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just being an introvert makes it sometimes difficult to step into the “outside” world. That’s why it’s great if you can find people who believe in you and are skilled in this networking thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October when it was still allowed to do so, we performed on stage at &lt;em&gt;CC Het Oude Badhuis&lt;/em&gt;. Our duet “Without You” (see below) got played on Radio 1 here in Belgium. Those are things that give positive energy. It’s great to reach people. For me, art is about feeling. I’ve had people look at my work and name the exact feelings I had while making the work. That was so scary, yet at the same time so magical. How is that even possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;433&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_YhVFLmfQIc&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of new music projects do you have in mind?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to find someone who I can work with like how John Parish and PJ Harvey work together, I think they have a wonderful collaboration. Further, I’d like to do several projects, to be totally immersed in music making. I really want to work with different types of musicians ’cause I think it helps one grow as a musician and artist. It’s really about the depth of it all, that’s what I’m searching for in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are doing some experiments to figure out how certain artists end up on Forgetify, an app that plays music that has absolutely no audience, and how to avoid this happening. Would you participate in an anonymous experimental music project with us to find out how algorithms learn to recommend new music?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure! Bring it on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I treat Data Feminism, the magnum opus of Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein as a guidebook to all sorts of power-related problems in big data, not only those specifically pertaining to womxn. The reason why Slovak artists of any gender are less likely to be recommended by a music streaming platform are similar to why Google Translate assumes “the professor” is a “he” every time. In this case, of course, the problems of data and power that we see so clearly represented here do specifically deal with gender and sexism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[T]he past data in question (like segregated housing patterns or single parentage) are products of structurally unequal conditions. These unequal conditions are true across large social groups, and yet the technology uses those data as predictive elements that will influence one person’s future. […] This is one of the challenges of using data about people as an input into a system: the data are never “raw.” Data are always the product of unequal social relations — relations affected by centuries of history. As computer scientist Ben Green states, “Although most people talk about machine learning’s ability to predict the future, what it really does is predict the past.” — &lt;a href=&#34;https://mitsap.medium.com/data-feminism-ad4263858321&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Introduction to Data Feminism&lt;/a&gt; by Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that Google has “read” all books, translations, dictionaries and whatever it can get its proverbial hands on, as well as recording for years how people use and correct its translation tool. In a patriarchal society, more men drive buses then women, and women are more often considered and described as beautiful than they are strong. Google considers the most used translation in the past the one that is most likely to be correct in future cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(To Google’s credit, if you enter only a single term, not an entire text, it explains the problem. The Hungarian language does not use gendered nouns and pronouns — even though Hungarian society is quite patriarchal in other ways!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big data reenforces existing power imbalances because it projects the past into the present and the future, through numbers and language. As a study published by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://fra.europa.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;European Union Agency For Fundamental Rights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2020/artificial-intelligence-and-fundamental-rights&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Getting the future right — Artificial intelligence and fundamental rights argues, justice and equality are fundamental rights&lt;/a&gt; argues, justice and equality are fundamental rights. Accordingly, everyone must have the right to challenge an algorithm that discriminates against them, in music streaming, recruitment processes, or other contexts, in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, a transparent, accountable, trustworthy AI is one that constantly checks for biases and changes them. This is the reason why black-box, proprietary algorithms can do more harm than good. If you want to correct injustices in music streaming, in everyday language use, or in a recruitment process, you must be able to verify the training dataset of an algorithm, its working principles, and its outcome as unbiased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our startup has initiated several collaborations open for citizen scientists, individual artists, universities and corporations as well to create validated, trustworthy datasets to train accountable algorithms. We are currently focusing on music and climate change, and will start new data programs in other cultural and environmental areas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[T]he past data in question (like segregated housing patterns or single parentage) are products of structurally unequal conditions. These unequal conditions are true across large social groups, and yet the technology uses those data as predictive elements that will influence one person’s future. […] This is one of the challenges of using data about people as an input into a system: the data are never “raw.” Data are always the product of unequal social relations — relations affected by centuries of history. As computer scientist Ben Green states, “Although most people talk about machine learning’s ability to predict the future, what it really does is predict the past.” — &lt;a href=&#34;https://mitsap.medium.com/data-feminism-ad4263858321&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Introduction to Data Feminism&lt;/a&gt; by Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that Google has “read” all books, translations, dictionaries and whatever it can get its proverbial hands on, as well as recording for years how people use and correct its translation tool. In a patriarchal society, more men drive buses then women, and women are more often considered and described as beautiful than they are strong. Google considers the most used translation in the past the one that is most likely to be correct in future cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(To Google’s credit, if you enter only a single term, not an entire text, it explains the problem. The Hungarian language does not use gendered nouns and pronouns — even though Hungarian society is quite patriarchal in other ways!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;busdriver.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big data reenforces existing power imbalances because it projects the past into the present and the future, through numbers and language. As a study published by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://fra.europa.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;European Union Agency For Fundamental Rights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2020/artificial-intelligence-and-fundamental-rights&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Getting the future right — Artificial intelligence and fundamental rights argues, justice and equality are fundamental rights&lt;/a&gt; argues, justice and equality are fundamental rights. Accordingly, everyone must have the right to challenge an algorithm that discriminates against them, in music streaming, recruitment processes, or other contexts, in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, a transparent, accountable, trustworthy AI is one that constantly checks for biases and changes them. This is the reason why black-box, proprietary algorithms can do more harm than good. If you want to correct injustices in music streaming, in everyday language use, or in a recruitment process, you must be able to verify the training dataset of an algorithm, its working principles, and its outcome as unbiased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our startup has initiated several collaborations open for citizen scientists, individual artists, universities and corporations as well to create validated, trustworthy datasets to train accountable algorithms. We are currently focusing on music and climate change, and will start new data programs in other cultural and environmental areas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Feasibility Study On Promoting Slovak Music In Slovakia &amp; Abroad</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-03-25-listen-slovak/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-help-promote-local-music&#34;&gt;How to help promote local music?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study opens the question of the local music promotion within the digital environment.
The Slovak Performing and Mechanical Rights Society (SOZA), the State51 music group in the United Kingdom, and the Slovak Arts Council commissioned Reprex to created a feasibility study which provides recommendations for better use of quotas for Slovak radio stations and which also maps the share and promotion of Slovak music within large streaming and media platforms such as Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;

      What should a good local content policy (radio quota, recommendation system, streaming quota) achieve?
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study proposes best practices for the introduction of mandatory quotas for Slovak radio stations and points out how current recommendation systems used by large platforms such as Spotify, YouTube, or Apple hardly consider local music from smaller countries. Local music stands against competition consisting of million songs from the whole world, and for ordinary Slovak musicians, whose music doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong to the global hits playlists, it is almost impossible to get recommended by the recommendation systems of large platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

      We aimed to create a demo version of a utility-based, transparent, accountable recommendation system.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to this problem could be the Listen Local App, built on a comprehensive reference database of local music, which we created as a demo version within the study. The app aims to help listeners discover more local music; the app also presents new and alternative ways for large digital platforms to recommend local artists. Through Listen Local, listeners search for artists and bands based on their taste and the city they are situated in. In this way, listeners can easily search for music by artists from particular cities or from the town they are about to visit.
We are releasing today the feasibility study in English and Slovak. We call for an open consultation to evaluate the results of this work and continue developing the Slovak Music Database, the Listen Local recommendation, and the AI validation system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Slovak Music Database is connected to Reprex&amp;rsquo;s flagship project, the Demo Music Observatory, an open collaboration-based demo version of the planned European Music Observatory, currently being further developed in the JUMP Music Market Accelerator Programme supported by Music Moves Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project website contains the &lt;a href=&#34;https://listenlocal.community/project/demo-sk-music-db/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;demo version of the Slovak Music Database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-steps&#34;&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next phase of the work, we add further data to our Slovak Demo Music Database and carry out more and more experiments and educational activities to understand how Slovak music can become more visible and targeted. We are also bringing this project into an international collaboration for better utilization of R&amp;amp;D efforts and experiences throughout Europe. This agile project method originated in reproducible scientific practice and open-source software development and allows participation in large projects on any scale: from individual musicians and educators to large research universities and music distributors. Anyone can join in on the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reprex is looking for further international partners; Reprex is currently part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://reprex.nl/post/2021-02-16-nlaic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dutch AI Coalition&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/european-ai-alliance&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;European AI Alliance&lt;/a&gt; project. SOZA and Reprex are committed to opening this project for international collaboration while ensuring that a significant part of the R&amp;amp;D activities remains in the Slovak Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are preparing informal, online information sessions for artists, promoters, researchers, and developers to join our project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Healing Effect of Sound and Music</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-03-22-flower-of-sound/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Mar 2021 19:19:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-03-22-flower-of-sound/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flower of Sound invites you to become more calm, inspired, energized or focused. Let the stress flow away and elevate your own frequency. Claudio is a fellow in the JUMP European Music Accelerator Program with a particularly interesting Milano and Amersfoort based startup, Flower of Sound. I visited him and his co-founder, Elise,in Seats2meet Amersfoort CS. I found their approach particularly interesting because the model of music streaming is already being overtaken by informative radio-style programming in the form of podcasts and, next to that, all sorts of functional sounds that help people to meditate, drown out noise in a co-working space, or just simply fall asleep. They made me realize that the boundary between the music market and something larger is becoming very thin, maybe disappearing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are you talking about sound and not music? How can immersive sound have a positive affect on you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claudio: We are talking about sound because we work with all kinds of auditory input, from very specific frequencies to nature sounds and ASMR (whisper voice). When you talk about music there is always a very specific assumption that there is a melody, or it is a comforting listening experience. We choose instead the possibility of healing as our core. For example, listening to just a pure tone can actually be a bit uncomfortable but it does have an effect on your body and mental state. The sound can create, for example, sonic illusions by activating certain specific areas in the brain, allowing people to recover memories of trauma from the past. Thanks to new technologies like neurofeedback we can formulate a proper sound therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe title=&#34;vimeo-player&#34; src=&#34;https://player.vimeo.com/video/307457833&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;466&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We work with immersive sound because it can have a higher positive effect than normal stereo sound for different reasons. In sound healing therapy, the different sound sources (for instance, Tibetan bowls) are often placed on the body or within someone’s energy field. With the use of spatial sound you can recreate this and let the body react in almost the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By creating an immersive experience, you enhance the overall effect. Think of going to the cinema compared to watching a movie on your phone: it opens up a new world of creativity and unexpected effects, because it is so new, and this element of surprise and awe creates an even more positive feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where is the boundary between sound design and music creation? How do you end up in a ‘music market accelerator’ with a sound design project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in an overlapping area because, with the way we have set up &lt;a href=&#34;http://flowerofsound.machinejockey.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Flower of Sound&lt;/a&gt;, we are both part of the music industry and also part of the “wellbeing” world. We want to distribute all our albums via the normal streaming services from Tidal to Spotify and Amazon HD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, we are creating a platform for a group of musicians, healers, and artists that have not found their way into the normal music world. For instance, we have recorded a sjaman playing his sound healing music, and from this we will create a spatial album and a VR experience. We will create, with the help of advanced sound design techniques, “neuro music” products for specific purposes from tantra training to stimulating neural activities, headache or nausea treatment. As you can see, we are far from music and closer to a medicine approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1ZcPitJYc15PCQdNGSrNeK&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a performer and as an inventor, what is the relevance of your location to you? How do you connect to your audience, your ecosystem in Milano? How will this change with virtualizing the experience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more we go virtual the more there is also a need for real life connection. So on the one end, it doesn’t matter where all of us are based, as long as we have access to high-speed internet. On the other hand, real life encounters will become more rare and precious: basically what is happening now during all these lockdowns. So it will come down to making careful decisions about when to travel to create these real life experiences, and at the same time making sure that with virtual communication channels we keep in touch and keep creating the intimacy that is needed to perform and create new projects.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elise&lt;/em&gt;: My number one insight is: &lt;em&gt;Why does the music industry make everything so complicated?&lt;/em&gt; So I am looking for ways to make things simpler so we can be as effective as we can. As a book coach and publisher I work with the rules of the book industry, but I am also always looking for ways to go around the industry to make a book more successful. Why is a book considered “old” three months after its release, for instance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am fascinated by how cultural the book industry is, from the way it’s organised to the details of which covers work best. This also applies to the music industry. What I will bring with me is that the basis of everything should be the why of a piece of music. And making sure that why is honoured throughout, because I believe that is the only way to bring it into fruition. So in our case we want to create a healing effect in combination with technology, so that will always be the core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almost no startups succeed without a good mix of co-founders. How did you find your co-founder, and what inspires you to go on after a setback or a disappointing day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elise: Finding a good co-founder is a combination of luck, knowing what you are looking for, and brutal honesty. I have different business partners for my other companies and the dynamic with each of them is different, but at the basis is trust in each other and sharing the same core values. For both of us, what inspires us is our shared vision of the future what we want to reach with Flower of Sound. There is this underlying feeling that we have to bring this into the world. Nowadays everybody knows what kinds of miracles sound and music perform on people; thanks to technology, now we can go further to discover the mechanisms behind why certain frequencies and rhythms affect our mood and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are both fellows in the JUMP European Music Market Accelerator program. What are your expectations from this program?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are hoping to find knowledge and help to bring forward our application as soon as possible; and to find the right people to propel us forward, good team members, and investors so we can really accelerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claudio, can you recommend us something to hear, visit, listen to physically in Milano once this pandemic is over?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claudio: One, you need to listen to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.collateralnature.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Collateral Nature&lt;/a&gt;, a hybrid music project that combines sound design and jazz through different immersive experiences, from a VR music clip to a Metaverse experience via WebXR, a Dolby Atmos format, and other new media content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then visit Ride, a temporary space for the urban arts (Milan Porta Genova MM2, May — September 2021), where a Flower of Sound immersive room will be installed in June with Atmos layout speakers.
Next: Base (Via Bergognone, Design District) with &lt;a href=&#34;https://zero.eu/en/luoghi/194380-la-capsula,milano/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Capsula&lt;/a&gt;, a 360 immersive audio layout, and Meet the Media Guru Center of Arts, an international artistic installation of new media.
And close by is the Navigly area: a lot of bars, great cocktails, and a great atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And Elise, can you tell us what to hear, visit, listen to physically in Amersfoort once the pandemic has ended?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elise&lt;/em&gt;: What I recommend in Amersfoort is to go to the city centre and just walk around the old town. Then wander towards what is called the “new city” and have a coffee there. Visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.seats2meet.com/nl/locations/322/Seats2meet-Amersfoort-CS&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Seats2meet Amersfoort CS&lt;/a&gt; for a meeting or co-work time and also see our immersive room at &lt;a href=&#34;http://speel-veld.nl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Speel-veld.nl&lt;/a&gt;. Amersfoort is really just in the middle of the Netherlands. We have a big tower in the city centre to prove it. We also have a lot of really cool festivals, from street theatre to food, to salsa and traditional Dutch music.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>From France: Destination East</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-03-21-hajde/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Mar 2021 19:19:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-03-21-hajde/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;HAJDE is a digital platform specializing in eco-responsible and cultural tourism in Eastern Europe. Its founder, Thibaut Boudaud, is developing his project alongside our music observatory in the JUMP European Music Market Accelerator. I spoke with him on a video platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;His first memories about the region are connected to his father, who served in the French zone of divided Berlin. Thibaut started to travel the region in 2008, starting with a memorable visit with Hungary’s Sziget Festival, then going further to Romania and Croatia. He has kept going back ever since: he has already visited 10 festivals in the region. On road trips with friends, on a crowdsourced fact-finding mission: he has found many ways to go back and get familiar with more and more places. I am particularly interested in Thibaut’s project, because he comes from a trajectory unknown to me, from France to the heart of the Balkans in Northern Macedonia. We have crossed each other’s routes, not yet knowing each other, on at least three occasions: on Sziget, in the summer of ’13 in Bosnia, and on the Sharpe showcase festival in Bratislava. Inspired by his travels, Thibaut went back to France to study first political science, then cultural policy, and decided to start a volunteer-based journalism website that opens up hidden aspects of the Balkans for the French readership.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thibaut’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://hajde.fr/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;hajde.fr&lt;/a&gt; was founded as a volunteer media site in 2016. He is fascinated with the cultural richness and the generosity of the people. However challenging the living conditions of the people he has met in Albania, North Macedonia or Montenegro, they give all to the traveler, and they always want to make sure that he returns with a good memory of their city or country. Thibaut managed to meet 60 cultural stakeholders in 8 countries on his four-month fact-finding expedition [Bridges to the Balkans] that was crowdfunded on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kisskissbankbank.com/fr/projects/bridges-to-the-balkans&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;KissKissBankBank&lt;/a&gt;. He is the first accredited journalist to cover a number of places, including the &lt;a href=&#34;https://hajde.fr/serbie/lovefest-serbie-vrnjacka-banja-festival-electro/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Lovefest Festival&lt;/a&gt; in Vrnjačka Banja (see their Facebook page &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/lovefestVB/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an organizational point of view, the festival is functioning quite well. We may regret imperfections here and there, whether in terms of crowd management in rainy weather (expect a lot of mud), or even the behavior of security (one of the members of the editorial staff, who did not speak Serbian, was told “learn to speak Serbian” from a security guard), but the facts are there, the festival is running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stages, too, are extremely well designed, from the Fire Stage, the main stage, where a metal juggernaut spits flames, to the Energy Stage, a more convivial stage hidden among the trees, on which rising stars give their best. Soundwise, the design is flawless: even when two stages are side by side, the acoustics have been so well designed that there will be no interference. In short, enough to have a good time in front of good DJs. On a programming level, the choices are consistent. While it was still possible a few years ago to meet Balkan rock stars on stage, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partibrejkers&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Partibrejkers&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 or &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS_%28band%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SARS&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, the festival is now 100% electro, from international references such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/stephanbodzin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Stephan Bodzin&lt;/a&gt; to rising Serbian stars like &lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/leadobricic&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Lea Dobričić&lt;/a&gt; . If you are a fan of electro, you will not have much time to spare during these four days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thibaut is particularly interested in national showcase festivals. He visited MaMA Festival 2018 in Paris as he was working for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.europavox.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Europavox&lt;/a&gt;, the first European cultural media outlet for music lovers, and had the opportunity to visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ment.si/news/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MENT&lt;/a&gt; in Ljubljana, &lt;a href=&#34;https://sharpe.sk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Sharpe&lt;/a&gt; in Bratislava and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/pinmusicconference/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;PIN&lt;/a&gt; in Skopje. He also met &lt;a href=&#34;https://emilygonneau.wordpress.com/contact/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Emily Gonneau&lt;/a&gt;, the music and tech entrepreneur and author who became a supporter of Hajde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thibaut started to think about professionalizing Hajde with the North Macedonian creative agency and artist group &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fabricca.cc/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Fabricca&lt;/a&gt;. They had a shared vision, and eventually a grant from the French cultural ministry allowed a complete redesign of the website and social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hajde is currently published by &lt;em&gt;Association Hajde Creative&lt;/em&gt;, and relies on &lt;a href=&#34;https://fr.tipeee.com/hajdefr&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;donations&lt;/a&gt;, crowdfunding and volunteers, but plans to find new revenue streams connected to tourist guides, cultural tourism, and festival tourism — among other ideas — to actually start to pay its citizen-journalists and to create more and even better content. Thibaut also wants to provide a different perspective on the region than is currently available in the French-language press. “People only hear that &lt;code&gt;[Hungarian Prime Minister]&lt;/code&gt; Viktor Orbán is terrible, that &lt;code&gt;[Serbian prime minister]&lt;/code&gt; Vučić is terrible. They hold very prejudiced views of Albanian or Romanian people. I want to show that there are many great things happening in the region, and there are many creative people doing great things in these countries.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hajde’s founder applied to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jumpmusic.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;JUMP European Music Market Accelerator&lt;/a&gt; to create &lt;a href=&#34;https://hajde.fr/general/actus/hajde-lance-hajde-radio/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hajde Radio&lt;/a&gt;, a music-oriented podcast and radio program, but this is only viable within a broader concept. Thibaut wants to create a self-brand as a curator, to find affiliations with cultural tourist destinations and festivals with all his media, and to generally show a different side of the region to a French-speaking audience. His plan has three focus points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hajde.fr/tendances/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Trendings&lt;/a&gt; brings together articles dealing with cultural discoveries (music, cinema, arts and literature, lifestyle), as well as the latest news and social trends for a better understanding of these countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hajde.fr/destination-est/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Go East&lt;/a&gt; will be the ultimate tourist guide to Eastern Europe, with must-see places (heritage, natural sites, cultural and underground places) and discoveries (food, traditions, green activities, outdoor activities and well-being). The expertise of its editors help the tourist choose the next destination, prepare for visits and take the time to travel in “slow tourism” style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hajde.fr/festivals/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Festivals&lt;/a&gt; and music have been in Hajde’s DNA since its beginning. Regularly updated pages are dedicated to the biggest festivals in the East as well as the most under-the-radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/6ESirwBrnBsIwocFK2hsmp&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that we can find a greater coverage for our &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; together with Hajde. Our &lt;a href=&#34;https://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;initial research area&lt;/a&gt; almost fully overlaps with Hajde’s, with the exception of Austria, and while we have been covering Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia and Bulgaria for a long time, we have not yet found a way into Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina and North Macedonia, where Hajde already has a strong network. They are also planning the launch of an app, where we see many connection points with our &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/listen-local/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; initiative and apps. Placing &lt;a href=&#34;https://hajde.fr/croatie/musique-croatie/blues-croate-daujourdhui/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Croatian blues&lt;/a&gt;, or placing Skopje on the global music map are exactly the type of challenges where we are looking forward to cooperating with Hajde’s community — as well as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/scenecityeu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Scene City EU&lt;/a&gt; project, which documents and showcases European scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thibaut is particularly fond of Northern Macedonia, a country where he has travelled extensively, and where he hopes to buy a house one day. I asked him to recommend some tunes from Skopje and the rest of the country. Enjoy the playlist!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Impacts of Covid-19 on the Live Music Industries: A Sample of Academic Projects Taking Place Across Europe</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-03-18-covid-impact-academic/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Mar 2021 19:19:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-03-18-covid-impact-academic/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a couple of months on planing, the IASPM event I organised on the impacts of Covid-19 on the European Music Industries took place yesterday. The event featured six speakers, from Wales, England, Germany, Norway and the Netherlands. This work builds on the previous work I have posted concerning the situation in Wales – which you can access &lt;a href=&#34;https://paulcarr.org/2020/11/21/live-music-in-wales-a-report-for-the-culture-welsh-language-and-communications-commitee/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://paulcarr.org/2020/12/03/paul-carr-presentation-to-culture-welsh-language-and-communications-committee-the-live-music-industry-in-wales-post-pandemic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was some fascinating discussion that took place both during and after the presentations, which you can now see via the recording below. For me, I think the one noticeable factor was how much all of our nations had in common. Despite different rules regarding the opening up of our respective venues, we all shared common concerns surrounding factors such as how best to support our live music industries post covid, how to identify gaps in our live music ecologies due to stakeholders leaving the profession, how to train those who wish to enter the profession and how to work with governments to ensure the necessary research takes place and communication infrastructures are in place. It will be interesting to monitor these various projects over the coming months to ascertain how much impact they have, but in the meantime enjoy the recording. Thanks to all of the speaks and the International Association for the Study of Popular Music for hosting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lapee: Making Festivals More Accessible For Women</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gina Périer is a fellow in the JUMP European Music Market Accelerator. She is an architect trying to solve a serious problem before music festivals reopen after the pandemic: many, many women, all in one place… who need to pee.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your personal connection to music and festivals?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I like going to festivals, partying and listening to the concerts. Then, I used to work as an architect for Roskilde Festival in Denmark, together with my co-founder Alexander. For us, it was a great opportunity to observe the impact of our design on the festival and on the crowd behavior. We started then observing issues around and trying to find simple solutions to improve the festival environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

               src=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-03-10-lapee/lapee_efficiency_hu4fa62e1f5db4d64229de598110d054bc_302402_2ae3b0d41cd593a70ffb9e4e9112cc3b.webp&#34;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lapee gives womxn the ability to pee in a secure and clean environment without waiting in line. Apart from personal experience, what sort of research did you do to understand the scope of the problem and the potential market? How do you feed back user experience to the design process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While being at the festival that I was working for, I was extremely concerned about how difficult it was to just pee as a womxn. No matter how much fun I was having, when it comes to pee, everything turns into a nightmare because we know we’re on to a good struggle. We’ll probably lose our friends, miss half of the concert, stay in an endless line to finally lock ourselves into a sticky cabin. Many times we would go for the “other option,” commonly known as the bushes, which is quite unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking around the festival populated with male urinals, it was quite hard to understand why there wasn’t a proper industrialized solution for womxn yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we started drawing Lapee, we made some 1/1 cardboard models and we invited different womxn to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you name another product or service that help womxn to participate more in music, either as members of the audience, or as creators, or technicians that you like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that safety is still quite an issue within the music industry. I have a friend who created an organisation, Club Mafia, which consists of having a community of people that can educate and help people in trouble or making trouble. Basically they are people in between safety guards and participants that are easier to reach out to and that are more understanding and value minded. They will listen to you if you feel uncomfortable and will go and explain to the person how not to make someone uncomfortable. I think it’s a great initiative!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say that the major problems I can observe in music are sexism, queerphobia and racism, and some ideas can help fighting against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I hope for more ideas that can improve equality. I also really hope for music organisations to speak up, be inclusive, promote better equality and not tolerate sexism, queerphobia and racism. The audience should educate themselves and organisations should use their power and influence to speak and educate their audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You were selected to JUMP along with us. What do you expect to gain from this European Music Accelerator?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beyond Human: Jazz Popcorn Robot</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Jazz Popcorn Robot&lt;/strong&gt; is a performance without a performer, without composer and audience, but still music. It is a creation of &lt;em&gt;Moritz Simon Geist&lt;/em&gt;, who is a performer, musicologist, and robotics engineer. His projects range from robotic music performances to robotic sound installations.&lt;/p&gt;

It is an opportunity to show the benefits of open data and encourage the adoption of open data policies in government, business, and civil society. Reprex is a start-up that utilizes open data with open-source reproducible research: please challenge us with your data requests and participate in our web events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Reprex Open Data Day 2021&lt;/code&gt; will be two informal conversations based on a series of run up introductory blogposts centered around two themes. Because important guests became ill in the last days, we are going to consolidate the two talks into one with less structure.  We want to create an informal, inclusive, collaborative online event on International Open Data Day 2021. Please, grab a tea, coffee, or even a beer, and join us for an informal conversation. We hope that we will finish the afternoon with ideas on new, open-data driven collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;9.30 EST / 15.30 CET&lt;/code&gt;:  &lt;strong&gt;Open collaboration in business, policy and science.&lt;/strong&gt;   Creating evidence-based policy, business strategy or scientific research with small contributions with independent components with incentives.  Short introduction with examples:  joining environmental sensory data and public opinion data on maps; creating harmonized datasets across the Arab world.  Survey harmonization, mapping, data products.  &lt;strong&gt;Scaling up open collaboration: making small organizations competitive with big tech in the big data era.&lt;/strong&gt;  Data sharing, data pooling, data altruism and observatories. The new European trustworthy AI and data governance agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/presentations/reprex_open_data_day_2021.html#/reprex&#34;&gt;click through&lt;/a&gt; a short presentation to familiarize yourself with our topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you &lt;a href=&#34;https://meet.jit.si/ReprexOpenDataDay2021&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case studies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are connecting raw survey data about Climate Awareness in Eurobarometer surveys.  Here is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rpubs.com/antaldaniel/734594&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;reproduction code&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;intermediate to advanced R needed&lt;/em&gt;.) You should use the &lt;em&gt;development&lt;/em&gt; version of our &lt;a href=&#34;retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu&#34;&gt;retroharmonize&lt;/a&gt; package at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/antaldaniel/retroharmonize&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;github.com/antaldaniel/retroharmonize&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are tracking changes in the boundaries of provinces, states, counties, parishes with our regions open source software &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://rpubs.com/antaldaniel/regions-OOD21&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;reproduction code here&lt;/a&gt;. You will need our &lt;a href=&#34;regions.dataobservatory.eu&#34;&gt;regions&lt;/a&gt; package which is available on CRAN or in the rOpenGov GitHub repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will talk about how to join this with air pollution data and put it on the map with &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-03-03-ood_interview_maps/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Milos Popovic&lt;/a&gt;, who prepared this nice choropleth animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>How to Speak About Music in the Digital Age from Taxonomies to Folksonomies</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-03-05-folksonomies/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Mar 2021 15:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-03-05-folksonomies/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the dawn of the digital age we have experienced an unprecedented proliferation of music tied to the emergence of digital tools and media channels that accelerate its production and dissemination. Music streaming platforms like Spotify, media platforms like YouTube, or alternative sales platforms like &lt;a href=&#34;https://bandcamp.com/tags&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt; make around 100 million songs available worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a conservative viewpoint the fact that everything is readily exposed to us (i.e. the flooding of content) can be seen as degrading to the cultural experience; conversely, one can celebrate the growth of free digital culture, where music production and promotion is tied to less constrains, and musical experience is enriched by blogs, podcasts and other music promotion services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not need to take sides, but we might agree that the digital explosion does not equate to instant access to relevant content — in certain cases it may trigger the opposite effect. There is so much music out there, with so many releases every week, that even professional users like radio editors, DJs or curators face challenges staying up to date. For the audience, this is even more challenging, and therefore all these platforms rely on some form of AI to make personalized recommendations or to automate the categorization of music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music might have a universal language, but finding music is rooted in natural languages, and users rely on simple verbal identifiers like genre labels. According to their broad &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tagg.org/others/ffabbri9907.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;definition&lt;/a&gt;, musical genres emerge as names to define similarities that identify musical events for the members of a community. These labels aid orientation within the sonic landscape, and make it easier for humans to give recommendations in a human conversation — and they are attached to extra-musical activities, too, because music is a social activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One goes to a concert and meets like-minded people, or at least there is a sense of togetherness triggered by a shared appreciation of the music. Music events are embedded into socio-cultural contexts that may prescribe forms of belonging, dress and behaviour codes, and are prone to economic regulation. Within popular music studies a range of concepts have been developed to grasp such communities, such as subcultures, neo-tribes or music scenes. One must take into account the multitude of sometimes overlapping subgenres and their varying interpretations by music lovers, which makes categorization even harder. More generic genre descriptions, like “rock” or “punk”, may sound straightforward and less confusing, but they are also less useful for uncovering complexities and nuances. More specific categories, like “darkwave” or “cold wave”, are more practical in this regard, but may sound pretty obscure or even esoteric to a non-specialist audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music tech companies that support labels, A&amp;amp;R, music supervisors, DJs, radio editors, music journalists, and the entire music and entertainment industry, attempt to cut through the turmoil of genre labels by providing (and improving) relatively detailed taxonomies, or well-designed labels that help both humans and AI-powered robots to find and connect to music. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.beatport.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Beatport&lt;/a&gt;, for example, is focused exclusively on electronic dance music, distributing its catalogue into 33 subgenres (as of Jan 2021, and counting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Beatport’s subgenre categories are not carved in stone. Particularly in electronic dance music, a meta-genre featuring &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.ishkur.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;a very high number of subgenres&lt;/a&gt;, such labels are often contested, and when it comes to niche genres, bottom-up, free tagging systems or &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vanderwal.net/folksonomy.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;folksonomies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; may better capture diversity and creativity, although they are less exact by their nature. These tags are rooted in the authentic, verbal descriptions of artists and promoters, and may refer to affective qualities and localities or express free associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abundance of subgenres is a hallmark of not only electronic dance music, but also of various indie, hip-hop, jazz or other music that has lively scenes and active, emerging artists. Within electronic dance music, scholars attribute it to various factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subgenre naming can be part of a merchandising strategy, related to a top-down model of genre categorization, where taxonomies are established by vendors or industry representatives such as Beatport. It may also reflect socially accepted musical qualities and innovations; folksonomies, by their nature, are at the forefront of such stylistic innovations. Folksonomies are also supported by certain independent music promotion and marketing websites. Bandcamp, for example, is seen as a reputable platform within the indie music community, and it also provides tagging possibilities for its artists and labels. In certain cases, such tags may offer a refreshing contrast to Beatport’s genre categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a cultural anthropologist, I have been involved in the study of alternative electronic dance music communities and event-based cultures; as is often the case, this interest has permeated into my personal life. Consequently, I have first hand experience of grassroots artists resisting classification to their music on the grounds that such labels are narrow and limiting — especially when they are defined by major industry vendors. At the same time, such categories provide basic orientation within a kaleidoscopic musical landscape, which can be especially useful for newcomers to a music scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://pypi.org/project/bandcamp-librarian/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bandcamp Dance Librarian&lt;/a&gt; project grew out of these impressions. In short, the project uses the industry taxonomy of Beatport in an attempt to detect stylistic tendencies or repertoires within the Bandcamp libraries of (mainly) grasroots labels. To achieve this, an automatic subgenre classifier is trained on Beatport’s Top-100 lists, which identifies the possible subgenres a track may belong to based on an audio analysis of its musical features. The classifier is then applied to detect the styles a Bandcamp library may belong to. The tracks pertaining to the whole library are first individually analysed, then distributed into groups or clusters based on their possible subgenre affiliations. The project output also show the tags (folksonomies) added by the artists/labels to the Bandcamp pages. It is therefore possible to compare the industry taxonomy of Beatport with artist folksonomies, as long as such tags are provided on Bandcamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at a working example. &lt;a href=&#34;https://sonicgroove.bandcamp.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Sonic Groove&lt;/a&gt; can be described a Berlin-based industrial techno label with strong EBM (Electronic Body Music) influences from a niche side of the electronic dance music spectrum. Neither industrial nor EBM techno are part of the Bandcamp taxonomy, so one can expect that the closest subgenres will be detected by the classifier. After running the Librarian we get a PDF report proposing three clusters with the following timeline distribution (the clustering algorithm may give different results each time):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cluster-0-techno-electro-and-indie-dance&#34;&gt;Cluster 0: Techno, Electro and Indie Dance&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first group (Cluster 0) is tentatively associated with the (&lt;em&gt;Raw-Deep-Hpynotic&lt;/em&gt;) Techno, (&lt;em&gt;Classic-Detroit-Modern&lt;/em&gt;) Electro and Indie Dance Beatport genres (the numbers in brackets represent confidence values). Three track examples are provided within each cluster, with links to their Bandcamp pages and their associated folksonomies:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second group is crystallized around more evident techno influences according to the classifier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/465WEBBmdsG2fIrmGq0KwZ&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the last cluster is predominantly classified as ambient. The example tracks are highly atmospheric, and their beats are less pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/48snI8H5RyBBinAJh0Zvq0&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tags associated to the tracks refer to subgenres (&lt;em&gt;EBM, industrial and electro&lt;/em&gt;), aesthetic modes (&lt;em&gt;purism, futurism&lt;/em&gt;), localities (&lt;em&gt;Berlin, Hamilton, New York&lt;/em&gt;) and moods (&lt;em&gt;desolation, subway&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the next blogpost I will get into more details on the project, discuss additional examples and touch on possible ramifications of this work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the announcement of JUMP, the European Music Market Accelerator, after a careful screening of all applications received, the selection committee composed of all JUMP board members has selected the most promising ideas and projects to be developed together with renowned tutors for this 2021 fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nine months, the 20 fellows living in many European countries will develop their innovative projects, while receiving a comprehensive 360° training. In addition to specialised workshops by highly qualified experts, each fellow will receive one-on-one tutoring sessions from the most renowned music professionals coming from all over Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20 selected projects cover a great variety of urgent needs faced within the music sector.
They will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;help fostering social change with projects focusing on diversity in the industry, more fairness and
transparency as well as raising awareness on timely issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enhance technological development with projects using blockchain, immersive sound and VR and AR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;build bridges between different key actors of the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Open Data Day Interview: Mapping Data with Milos Popovic</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-03-03-ood_interview_maps/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 22:23:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-03-03-ood_interview_maps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Milos Popovic is a researcher, a data scientist, Marie Curie postdoc &amp;amp; Top 10 dataviz &amp;amp; R contributor on Twitter according to NodeXL. He took part in policy debates about terrorism and military intervention and appeared on a number of TV channels including N1 (the CNN affiliate in the Western Balkans), Serbian National Television and Al-Jazeera Balkans. My research interests are at the intersection of civil war dynamics and postwar politics in the Balkans. He is going to join the Data &amp;amp; Lyrics team on International Open Data Day to help us put harmonized environmental degradation perception and environmental sensory data on maps. We asked him four questions about his passion, mapping data. Please join us 6 March 2021 9.30 EST / 15.30 CET for an informal digital coffee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a researcher, why are you so much drawn into maps? Is this connected to your interest in territorial conflicts, or you have some other inspiration?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a great question that really makes me pause and look back at the past 5 years. My mapping story started out of curiosity: I found interesting data on the post-WWII violence in Serbia and thought how cool it would be to make a map in R. I quickly made an unimpressive choropleth map and noticed some unexpected patterns. Then I realized just how much unused violence and census data sits out there while we have no clue about geographic patterns. So, it began. I started off with map-making but my curiosity took me to the world of georeferencing and geospatial analysis. In the process, I created over 300 maps hosted on my website as well as dozens of shapefiles from the scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think that my interest is linked to growing up in a war-torn country. But, as my map-making evolved, I discovered that my passion is to use maps as a way to democratize the data: to take the scores of unused, and often buried datasets, place them on the map and share the dataviz with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you show us an example of the best use of mapped data, and the best map that you have personally created? What is their distinctive value?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m immensely proud of my work that required making the shapefiles from the scratch. For instance, my shapefile of over 1500 Kosovo cadastral settlements came into being after I turned dozens of high-resolution raster files into a shapefile fully compatible with Open Street Maps. After months of hard work, I managed to merge the shapefile with the 2011 Kosovo census and present several laser-focused demographic maps to my audience. Same goes for the settlement shapefile of &lt;em&gt;Republika Srpska&lt;/em&gt; [the Serb-speaking entity of Bosnia-Herzegovina — the editor], which I made out of a pdf file and merged with the 2013 census data. Whereas most existing maps take a bird’s eye view, my work offers a more fine-grained view of the local dynamics to stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another similar undertaking was my transformation of the pre-WWII German military map of Yugoslavia into a unique shapefile of a few hundred Yugoslav municipalities. I combined this shapefile with the 1931 census data, 80 years after it was first published (better late than never!). It took me almost a year to complete this tremendous project but I enjoyed every bit of it. I have teamed up with &lt;a href=&#34;https://aleksandarpopovic.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;my brother&lt;/a&gt; who is a web developer and we even made &lt;a href=&#34;https://milosp.info/maps/interactive/census1931/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;an interactive map of Yugoslavia based on the 1931 census&lt;/a&gt;.[&lt;em&gt;The screenshot of this interactive map is the top image in the post &amp;ndash; the editor&lt;/em&gt;] We hope this project would serve not only scholars but also history enthusiasts to better understand a history of the country that is no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think about collaboration based on open data and open-source software that processes such data?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a fantastic opportunity for small teams to bypass traditional gatekeepers such as state institutions or big companies and use open source apps for the benefit of their local communities. For example, the access to Open Street Map allows small teams to map pressing communal issues as crime, deceases, or environmental degradation and come up with innovative solutions. In my work, too, I used OSM has helped me create several fine-grained maps that shed more light on local problems in Serbia such as pollution, car accidents or violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are hoping to bring together environmental, sensory data and public attitude data on environmental issues? How can mapping help? What do you expect from this project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than ever, we are compelled to figure out how maladies spreads locally. Without mapping the hotspots, our understanding of the consequences of, for example, viral transmission or pollution is shrouded with a lot of uncertainty. We might have no clue how environmental issues shape public attitudes in localities until we use the mapping to turn on the light. Mapping would help this project pin down geographic clusters that require immediate attention from the private and public stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please [join us](&lt;a href=&#34;https://reprex.nl/talk/reprex-Open&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://reprex.nl/talk/reprex-Open&lt;/a&gt; data-day-2021/) for a digital coffee, tea or beer on International Open Data Day - we will put never seen data on maps, and discuss how to build successful open collaborations, with little, independent contributions to build large data observatories.

      <title>Do Independent Labels and Major Record Labels Compete on a Level Playing Field When It Comes to Streaming?</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-03-01-major-vs-independent/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2021 07:23:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-03-01-major-vs-independent/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do Independent Labels and Major Record Labels Compete on a Level Playing Field When It Comes to Streaming? According to the written evidence submitted by Dr. Franco Mariuzzo and Dr. Peter Ormosi to the Economics of music streaming inquiry of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/15122/html/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;UK Parliament, Digital, Culture, Media, and Sports Committee&lt;/a&gt;, the answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared the number of streams for 719 artists represented by the major labels Sony and UMG and 1101 artists represented by independent labels to assess whether similarly popular artists had the same chance to rack up new streams over a period of two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying advanced econometric techniques (you can read their publication before scientific peer-review &lt;a href=&#34;https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=587025086112006006104031017104122104113073037034031091095095089113004080075007105067020007042040000015016073015122067013079078037066031008013103119025115019095109091035012104070084028121027073072117103088016126127066004119110082124031112023000087116&amp;amp;EXT=pdf&amp;amp;INDEX=TRUE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), the researchers ensured that the artists being compared met rigorous statistical similarity criteria. The growth prospects of artists represented by Sony and UMG do not appear to be significantly different. However, the researchers found significant differences in growth prospects when comparing artists associated with major and independent labels.&lt;/p&gt;

      UMG and Sony artitsts gather streams more quickly. The two companies happen to be Spotify shareholders.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One possible explanation could be that major label artists feature disproportionately in Spotify generated playlists, which gives them access to distributional channels — and consequently revenue — that indie labels do not have. Our simulation results confirm this explanation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying a Gibrat’s law on revenue shares, the competition economists show that even if you only listen to your friend’s music in Slovakia or the Netherlands, most of the subscription fee you pay is allocated to artists such as Ed Sheeran or Ariana Grande.&lt;/p&gt;

      Major label releases appear to generate more streams.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UMG and Sony artitsts gather streams more quickly. The two companies happen to be Spotify shareholders.
This research is consistent with the findings of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-02-21-cnm-streaming/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Centre National de la Musique and Deloitte&lt;/a&gt;, which show that the income of certain music genres that major labels invest into —such as rap and Afrobeat — receive about 20% more income than their share in streams at the expense of other genres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our own investigation with &lt;a href=&#34;https://listenlocal.community/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; focused on the artists who are never recommended at all and ended up on &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-24-forgetify_pop_october/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Forgetify&lt;/a&gt;. Our data suggests, but not yet proves, that certain countries of origin have a similar disadvantage. We are building &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;a Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; to continuously share, collect data that can help empirically decide questions in such inquiries.  And we’ll join forces with Dr. Mariuzzo and Dr. Ormosi to find it out!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Music Streaming: Is It a Level Playing Field?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our article, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.competitionpolicyinternational.com/music-streaming-is-it-a-level-playing-field/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music Streaming: Is It a Level Playing Field?&lt;/a&gt; is published in the February 2021 issue of CPI Antitrust Chronicle, which is fully devoted to competition policy issues in the music industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dramatic growth of music streaming over recent years is potentially very positive. Streaming provides consumers with low cost, easy access to a wide range of music, while it provides music creators with low cost, easy access to a potentially wide audience. But many creators are unhappy about the major streaming platforms. They consider that they act in an unfair way, create an unlevel playing field and threaten long-term creativity in the music industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our paper describes and assesses the basis for one element of these concerns, competition between recordings on streaming platforms. We argue that fair competition is restricted by the nature of the remuneration arrangements between creators and the streaming platforms, the role of playlists, and the strong negotiating power of the major labels. It concludes that urgent consideration should be given to a user-centric payment system, as well as greater transparency of the factors underpinning playlist creation and of negotiated agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What If Your Stream Count Would Count For The Artists?</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-02-21-cnm-streaming/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2021 09:10:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-02-21-cnm-streaming/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what many believe, your music streaming history plays a relatively small role in the payouts of the artists whose songs you are listening to. The streaming platforms use a MCPS, or market-centred payout system, which is biased towards large market listeners. Contrary to UCPS, or user-centred payout systems, where all streams by all users are tallied up to determine the final distribution of subscription and advertisement revenues, MCPS uses weighted averaging that very heavily favours major music distributors and the biggest global stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyze these competition policy problems with Amelia Fletcher and Peter L. Ormosi in our forthcoming publication in a special issue of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.competitionpolicyinternational.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Competition Policy International&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Music streaming: is it a level playing field?&lt;/em&gt;. But in the meantime, an interesting impact assessment emerged from France, because the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cnm.fr/en/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Centre National de la Musique&lt;/a&gt; commissioned Deloitte to make an impact assessment on &lt;a href=&#34;https://cnm.fr/le-cnm-evalue-limpact-dun-changement-eventuel-de-mode-de-remuneration-par-les-plateformes-de-streaming/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;a possible change&lt;/a&gt;. Deezer provided a full overview of its 2019 payouts, while Spotify gave a sample of 100,000 artist payouts, and the other streaming services — for example, Apple Music — refused to cooperate with the French government-backed institution. You can read an English language summary and an excellent commentary from Emmanuel Legrand on his blog: &lt;a href=&#34;https://legrandnetwork.blogspot.com/2021/02/user-centric-model-would-not-lead-to.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;User-centric model would not lead to significant changes in the distribution of music streaming royalties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Which genres would be winners and losers in the fair payout?
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fair distribution would completely alter the revenues of different genres. The biggest winner would be classical music, but various forms of pop, rock, jazz and disco artists would earn 15–25% more revenue. Currently, rap and hip-hop take about an extra 20% royalty revenue at the expense of these genres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The streaming providers, which are directly or indirectly part-owned by major labels, are playing down the results, claiming that the difference would translate only to a few euros per artists at the bottom of the pyramid. In a sense, this is true, because streaming royalties are generally very low. But averaging is extremely misleading, because it includes millions of songs that are out-of-date or for another reason are never heard. In fact, entire scenes and labels would earn about 10% more revenue globally, considering that streaming revenues add up to half or even more of their total recording revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reprex, our start-up, is based in the Netherlands and the United States that validated its early products in the &lt;a href=&#34;post/2020-09-25-yesdelft-validation/&#34;&gt;Yes!Delft AI+Blockchain Lab&lt;/a&gt; in the Hague. In 2021, we decided to join the Dutch AI Coalition &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://nlaic.com/en/about-nl-aic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;NL AIC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NL AIC is a public-private partnership in which the government, the business sector, educational and research institutions, as well as civil society organisations collaborate to accelerate and connect AI developments and initiatives. The ambition is to position the Netherlands at the forefront of knowledge and application of AI for prosperity and well-being. We are continually doing so with due observance of both the Dutch and European standards and values. The NL AIC functions as the catalyst for AI applications in our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are particularly looking forward to participating in the Culture working group of NLAIC, but we will also take a look at the Security, Peace and Justice and the Energy and Sustainability working groups.  Reprex is committed to use and further develop AI solutions that fulfil the requirements of trustworthy AI, a human-centric, ethical, and accountable use of artificial intelligence.  We are committed to develop our data platforms, or automated data observatories, and our Listen Local system in this manner. Furthermore, we are involved in various scientific collaborations that are researching ideas on future regulation of copyright and fair competition with respect to AI algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are committed to applying reproducible in an open collaboration with our business, scientific, policy and civil society partners, and facilitate the use of open data and open-source software.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ensuring the Visibility and Accessibility of European Creative Content on the World Market: The Need for Copyright Data Improvement in the Light of New Technologies</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-02-13-european-visibility/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Feb 2021 18:10:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-02-13-european-visibility/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The majority of music sales in the world is driven by AI-algorithm powered robots that create personalized playlists, recommendations and help programming radio music streams or festival lineups. It is critically important that an artist’s work is documented, described in a way that the algorithm can work with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our research paper – soon to be published – made for the Listen Local Initiative we found that 15% of Dutch, Estonian, Hungarian, or Slovak artists had no chance to be recommended, and they usually end up on &lt;a href=&#34;post/2020-11-17-recommendation-analysis/&#34;&gt;Forgetify&lt;/a&gt;, an app that lists never-played songs of Spotify. In another project with rights management organizations, we found that about half of the rightsholders are at risk of not getting all their royalties from the platforms because of poor documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how come that distributors give streaming platforms songs that are not properly documented?  What sort of information is missing for the European repertoire’s visibility?  Reprex is exploring this problem in a practical cooperation with SOZA, the Slovak Performing and Mechanical Rights Society, and in an academic cooperation that involves leading researchers in the field. A manuscript co-authored Martin Senftleben, director of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ivir.nl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Institute for Information Law&lt;/a&gt; in Amsterdam, and eminent researchers in copyright law and music economics, Reprex’s co-founder makes the case that Europe must invest public money to resolve this problem, because in the current scenario, the documentation costs of a song exceed the expected income from streaming platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the European Strategy for Data, the European Commission highlighted the EU’s ambition to acquire a leading role in the data economy. At the same time, the Commission conceded that the EU would have to increase its pools of quality data available for use and re-use. In the creative industries, this need for enhanced data quality and interoperability is particularly strong. Without data improvement, unprecedented opportunities for monetising the wide variety of EU creative and making this content available for new technologies, such as artificial intelligence training systems, will most probably be lost. The problem has a worldwide dimension. While the US have already taken steps to provide an integrated data space for music as of 1 January 2021, the EU is facing major obstacles not only in the field of music but also in other creative industry sectors. Weighing costs and benefits, there can be little doubt that new data improvement initiatives and sufficient investment in a better copyright data infrastructure should play a central role in EU copyright policy. A trade-off between data harmonisation and interoperability on the one hand, and transparency and accountability of content recommender systems on the other, could pave the way for successful new initiatives. &lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3785272&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Download the manuscript from SSRN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&#34;post/2020-12-17-demo-slovak-music-database/&#34;&gt;Slovak Demo Music Database&lt;/a&gt; project is a best example for this. We started systematically collect publicly available information from Slovak artists (in our write-in process) and ask them to give GDPR-protected further data (in our opt-in process) to create a comprehensive database that can help recommendation engines as well as market-targeting or educational AI apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that one of the problems of current AI algorithms that they solely or almost only work with English language documentation, putting other, particularly small language repertoires at risk of being buried below well-documented music mainly arriving from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are looking for rightsholders and their organizations, artists,
researchers to work with us to find out how we can increase the visibility of European music.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Please give us ideas, comments to our pre-print manuscript, which is available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3785272&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SSRN&lt;/a&gt; our for &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/media/publications/SSRN-id3785272.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;direct download&lt;/a&gt; here on Data &amp;amp; Lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the European Strategy for Data, the European Commission highlighted the EU’s ambition to acquire a leading role in the data economy. At the same time, the Commission conceded that the EU would have to increase its pools of quality data available for use and re-use. In the creative industries, this need for enhanced data quality and interoperability is particularly strong. Without data improvement, unprecedented opportunities for monetising the wide variety of EU creative and making this content available for new technologies, such as artificial intelligence training systems, will most probably be lost. The problem has a worldwide dimension. While the US have already taken steps to provide an integrated data space for music as of 1 January 2021, the EU is facing major obstacles not only in the field of music but also in other creative industry sectors.

      <title>Save The Date: Open Data Day 2021 on 6th March</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Open data is not only a cheap resource for scientists or NGOs, but a serious business opportunity for the business sector, too. The European Union has been promoting the business reuse of data collected at the taxpayer’s expense since 2003 – and our team members have been involved since the beginning. This is a particularly good deal opportunity for small businesses and organizations that do not have a big data infrastructure or budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;strong&gt;Open Data Day 2021&lt;/strong&gt;, our goal is to demonstrate how our open-source software can connect different sources and types of data to generate new knowledge about environmental sustainability by combining several perspectives: from air pollution sensors, public perceptions and opinions, and government policies. We will show how to connect environmental sensory data, environmental spending, and opinion polling data about the environment together with open-source software from open data sources, to follow the four highlighted topics of #ODD21. We’ll offer tutorials, webinars, and Q&amp;amp;A based around these topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who would think that you can use &amp;ldquo;raw inflation data components&amp;rdquo; to create &lt;em&gt;cultural&lt;/em&gt; indicators? Working with open data often feels like working with raw diamonds, because most open data was originally collected and processed for a different use that you would have in mind. But this is our expertise – if you want to see public financing, opinion polling or sensory information about environmental and sustainability issues, &lt;strong&gt;do challenge us&lt;/strong&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We want to help small organizations with big data.&lt;/strong&gt; Big data creates inequalities. Only the largest corporations, government bureaucracies, and scientific organizations have the human financial resources to create large, consistent datasets. We help our clients to access datasets of sufficient size, and to build trustworthy scientific, policy, business, or AI applications with the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our new website, &lt;a href=&#34;https://reprex.nl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;reprex.nl&lt;/a&gt; leaves the two flagship project &amp;mdash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://listenlocal.community/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; pages intact, and connects through our service offering. The Data&amp;amp;Lyrics blog will remain open for many interesting topics that we find interesting for our partners, friends, readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-access&#34;&gt;Data Access&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reprex grew out of CEEMID, a project that connected data and pooled surveys across twelve countries and over fifty music industry stakeholders to create thousands of relevant policy, statistical, and scientific indicators for the music and creative industries. (See the Central European Music Industry Report 2020 at &lt;a href=&#34;https://ceereport2020.ceemid.edu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ceereport2020.ceemid.edu&lt;/a&gt;.) Reprex offers services to help small organizations access data and use data in a trustworthy way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI requires large datasets to be effective, small organizations face challenges in harnessing the benefits of algorithms &amp;mdash; or, worse, biased algorithms created for different purposes will work against their strategic goals. We want to help our clients with pooling, sharing data, and validating or creating trustworthy applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you cannot find the right data for your policy evaluation, your consulting project, your PhD thesis, your market research, or your scientific research project, it does not mean that the data does not exist, or that it is not available for free. In our experience, up to 95% of available open data is never used, because potential users do not realize it exists or do not know how to access it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, thousands of new datasets become available via the EU open data regime, freedom of information legislation in the United States and other jurisdictions, or open science and scientific reproducibility requirements — but as these datasets have been packaged or processed for different primary, original uses, they often require open data experts to locate them and adapt them to a usable form for reuse in business, scientific, or policy research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creative and cultural industries often do not participate in government statistics programs because these industries are typically comprised of microenterprises that are exempted from statistical reporting and that file only simplified financial statements and tax returns. This means that finding the appropriate private or public data sources for creative and cultural industry uses requires particularly good data maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Data curation&lt;/code&gt; means that we are continuously mapping potential data sources and sending requests to download and quality test the most current data sources. Our CEEMID project has produced several thousand indicators, of which a few dozen are available in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/music-observatory/&#34;&gt;Demo Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt;.If you have specific data needs for a scientific research, policy evaluation, or business project, we can find and provide the most suitable, most current, and best value data for analysis or for &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/service/trustworthy-ai/&#34;&gt;ethical AI applications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data Processing</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/services/data-processing/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data analysts spend 80% of their time on data processing, even though computers can perform these task much faster, with far less errors, and they can document the process automatically. Data processing can be shared: an analyst in a company and an analyst in an      NGO does not have to reprocess the very same data twice&lt;/em&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See our blogpost &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-11-06-indicator_value_added/&#34;&gt;How We Add Value to Public Data With Imputation and Forecasting?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public data sources are often plagued by missng values. Naively you may think that you can ignore them, but think twice: in most cases, missing data in a table is not missing information, but rather malformatted information. This approach of ignoring or dropping missing values will not be feasible or robust when you want to make a beautiful visualization, or use data in a business forecasting model, a machine learning (AI) applicaton, or a more complex scientific model. All of the above require complete datasets, and naively discarding missing data points amounts to an excessive waste of information. In this example we are continuing the example a not-so-easy to find public dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completing missing datapoints requires statistical production information (why might the data be missing?) and data science knowhow (how to impute the missing value.) If you do not have a good statistician or data scientist in your team, you will need high-quality, complete datasets. This is what our automated data observatories provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a better solution. You can always rely on our API to import directly the latest, best data, but if you want to be sure, you can use our &lt;a href=&#34;https://zenodo.org/record/5652118#.YYhGOGDMLIU&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;regular backups&lt;/a&gt; on Zenodo. Zenodo is an open science repository managed by CERN and supported by the European Union. On Zenodo, you can find an authoritative copy of our indicator (and its previous versions) with a digital object identifier, for example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5652118&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;10.5281/zenodo.5652118&lt;/a&gt;. These datasets will be preserved for decades, and nobody can manipulate them. You cannot accidentally overwrite them, and we have no backdoor access to modify them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We want to ensure that individual researchers, artists, and professionals, as well as NGOs and small and large organizations can benefit equally from big data in the age of artificial intelligence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big data creates inequality and injustice because it is only the big corporations, big government agencies, and the biggest, best endowed universities that can finance long-lasting, comprehensive data collection programs. Big data, and large, well-processed, tidy, and accurately imputed datasets allow them to unleash the power of machine learning and AI. These large entities are able to create algorithms that decide the commercial success of your product and your artwork, giving them a competitive edge against smaller competitors while helping them evade regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Feasibility Study On Promoting Slovak Music In Slovakia &amp; Abroad</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/publication/listen_local_2020/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Dec 2020 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/publication/listen_local_2020/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Download the study &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/media/publications/Listen_Local_Feasibility_Study_2020_SK.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;in Slovak&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/media/publications/Listen_Local_Feasibility_Study_2020_EN.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;in English&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, realizing the low visibility and income-generating potential of Slovak music, the legislation introduced an amendment to the broadcasting act to regulate local content in radiostreams. The Slovak content promoting policy was well-intended but not based on any impact assessment, and it reached its goal only partially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Slovak broadcasting quotas in comparison with other national quotas a very simple, and they are impossible to measure, which makes both compliance and enforcement very difficult. Radio editors do not get any help to find music that fits into the playlists and fulfil the quota obligations – in many cases, it is impossible for them to find out if a song actually meets the quota requirements. For the same reason, neither is enforcement possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another deficiency of the broadcasting quotas is that because of its fuzzy target, it is not clear whom it tries to help, and it has few friends. It is unclear how performers, composers or Slovak music producers can benefit from the system. Furthermore, it only helps a few genres, and it decreases the chances of other Slovak music in instrumental and non-Slovak language genres (for example, classical, jazz, rock) to be heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at last, radio is losing its importance in music discovery. New generation find the music during their music discovery age on YouTube and digital streaming platforms. A Slovak content promoting policy that does not work on digital streaming platforms will be obsolete when radio content providers will switch to digital streaming in the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Feasibility Study follows the following logic:&lt;/strong&gt;
In the first chapter we introduce various music recommendation systems in the context of local content promotion polices, like local mandatory content quota regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second chapter, we consider the market-based or creative industry economy supporting policy goals, measurements, and potential support given to artists and producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then turn in the third chapter to content-based local regulations promoting the use of the Slovak language or Slovak music content, irrespective of the performers and producers nationality, residence or ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We introduce the idea of the &lt;strong&gt;Slovak Music Database&lt;/strong&gt;, a comprehensive, mainly opt-in, opt-out database that of Slovak artists and Slovak music that should be supported by the local content regulation and other policies. We also create a Demo Slovak Music Database to understand the problem and scope of the creation of the comprehensive version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project website contains the &lt;a href=&#34;https://listen-local.net/project/demo-sk-music-db/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Slovak Music Database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also created a &lt;a href=&#34;https://listen-local.net/project/demo-app/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Recommendation System&lt;/a&gt;. We explain here &lt;a href=&#34;https://listen-local.net/post/2020-11-23-alternative-recommendations/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;why&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;##Research questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why are the total market shares of Slovak music relatively low both on the domestic and the foreign markets?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we measure the market share of the Slovak music in the domestic and foreign markets?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we measure the value gap between what some media platforms, most particularly the biggest YouTube, does not pay out to the Slovak stakeholders within Slovakia?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the interplay of the various definitions on market share and national quota targets?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How ‘shadow-markets’ of home copying and unlicensed media platforms, such as YouTube impact market shares directly and national quotas indirectly?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can modern data science, predictive microeconomics and statistics help increase the market share of Slovak music in Slovakia and abroad?&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are finalizing our first local recommendation system, Listen Local Slovakia, and the accompanying Demo Slovak Music Database. Our aim is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show how the Slovak repertoire is seen by media and streaming platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the possibilities to give greater visibility to the Slovak repertoire in radio and streaming platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the specific problems why certain artists and music is almost invisible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next year, we would like to create a modern, comprehensive national music database that serves music promotion in radio, streaming, live music within Slovakia and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To train our locally relevant, &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-12-15-alternative-recommendations/&#34;&gt;alternative recommendation system&lt;/a&gt;, we filled the Demo Slovak Music Database from two sources. In the &lt;code&gt;opt-in&lt;/code&gt; process we asked artists to participate in Listen Local, and we selected those artists who opted in from Slovakia, or whose language is Slovak. In the &lt;code&gt;write-in&lt;/code&gt; process we collected publicly available data from other artists that our musicology team considered to be Slovak, mainly on the basis of their language use, residence, and other public biographical information. The following artists form the basis of our experiment. (&lt;em&gt;If you want to be excluded from the write-in list, &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/#contact&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;write to us&lt;/a&gt;, or you want to be included, please, fill out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ll_collector_2020&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe seamless =&#34;&#34; name=&#34;iframe&#34; src=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/htmlwidgets/sk_artist_table.html&#34; width=&#34;1000&#34; height=&#34;1050&#34; &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern recommendation systems usually rely on data provided by artists or their representatives, data on who and how is listening to their music, and what music is listened to by the audience of the artists, and certain musicological features of the music.  Usually they collect data from various data sources, but these data sources are mainly English language sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with these recommendation systems is that they do not help music discovery, and make starting new acts very difficult. Recommendation systems tend to help already established artists, and artists whose work is well described in the English language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our alternative recommendation system is a utility-based system that gives a user-defined priority to artists released in Slovakia, or artists identified as Slovak, or both. The system can be extended for lyrics language priorities, too.
Currently, our app is demonstration to provide a more comprehensive database-driven tool that can support various music discovery, recommendation or music export tools. Our Feasibility Study to build such tools and our Demo App is currently under consultation with Slovak stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/tag/listen-local/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; is developing transparent algorithms and open source solutions to find new audiences for independent music. We want to correct the injustice and inherent bias of market leading big data algorithms. If you want&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;your music and audience&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;to be analysed in Listen Local, fill&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ll_collector_2020&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;in. We will include you in our demo application for local music recommendations and our analysis to be revealed in December.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recommendation systems utilize knowledge about music content and their audiences while also pursuing the objectives or needs of recommenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest recommendation systems just follow the charts: for example, they select from well-known current or perennial greatest hits. Such a system may work well for an amateur DJ in a home party or a small local radio that just wants to make sure that the music in its programme will be liked by many people. They reinforce existing trends and make already popular songs and their creators even more popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the recommendation engine is supported by big data and a machine learning system &amp;ndash; or increasingly, a combination of several machine learning algorithms &amp;ndash; the general &lt;em&gt;modus operandi&lt;/em&gt; is to exploit information about both content and users in order to achieve certain goals.&lt;/p&gt;

      How recommendation systems work?
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify’s recommendation system is a mix of content- and collaborative filtering that exploits information about users’ past behaviour (e.g. liked, skipped, and re-listened songs), the behaviour of similar users, as well as data collected from the users&amp;rsquo; social media and other online activities, or from blogs. Deezer uses a similar system that is boosted by the acquisition of Last.fm &amp;ndash; big data created from user comments are used to understand the mood of the songs, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Spotify makes 16 billion music recommendations each month in 2020.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube, which plays an even larger role in music discovery, uses a system comprised of two neural networks: one for candidate generation and one for ranking. The candidate generation deep neural network provides works on the basis of collaborative filtering, while the ranking system is based on content-based filtering and a form of utility ranking that takes into consideration the user&amp;rsquo;s languages, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes these systems common is that they maximize the algorithm creators&amp;rsquo; corporate key performance indicators. Spotify wants to be ‘your playlist to life’ and increase the amount of music played during work or sports in the background, during travelling, or active music listening –- i.e. maximizing the number of hours spent using it, and do not let empty timeslots for other music providers, such as radio stations. YouTube and Netflix have similar targets. They are in many ways like commercial radio targets, which want to maximize the time spent listening to the broadcast stream. Radios and YouTube, in particular, have similar goals because they are mainly financed through advertising. For Spotify or Netflix, their key financial motivation is to avoid users&amp;rsquo; cancelling their subscriptions or changing it to different providers, such as Amzon, Apple or Deezer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-problem-with-black-box-recommendation-systems&#34;&gt;What is the problem with black box recommendation systems?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they also have in common is that they do not aim to give a fair chance to each uploaded song, serve equally every artist, or provide whatever equality of chances for English, Slovak or Farsi language content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They tend to reinforce trends similarly to music charts, but with far bigger efficiency. As the Dutch comedian, author and journalist Arjen Lubach explains the YouTube algorithm, to keep their personal recommendations engaging all the day and all of the night, they create a comfortable universe for the user allows little distraction in. If the user wants to listen to global hit music, or stoner rock, it will never be distracted with anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;710&#34; height=&#34;410&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FLoR2Spftwg?cc_load_policy=1&amp;origin=http://dataandlyrics.com&amp;cc_lang_pref=en&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zondag met Lubach on Dutch public broadcaster VPRO. Click settings sign to change the language of the captions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with such hyper-personalized media is that they leave no room for public activities.  Public broadcasters, which had a monopoly to television broadcasting in most European countries until the early 1990s, for example, were aiming to air a diversity of news, knowledge and access to local culture. Many countries on all continents have maintained &lt;code&gt;local content guidelines&lt;/code&gt; for broadcasting on public, commercial and community television and radio channels, for example, local music and films, and reliable news as a public service. Personalized media-, social media- and streaming platforms do not have such obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black box recommendation systems usually maximize a corporate key performance indicator, and they are not subject to usual public new service or local content regulations that traditional broadcast media is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal and the steps that the algorithm is pursuing is not know to content creators, and they do not know when will the algorithm work for their benefit or against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transparent-and-regulated-ai&#34;&gt;Transparent and regulated AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our view, utility-based recommendation system can provide a bridge between current, corporate-owned systems that maximize a media or streaming platforms&amp;rsquo; business indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public new service requirements or local content requirements (&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;national quotas&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;) set for commercial broadcasting are similar to utility or knowledge-based recommendation systems. A utility-based recommendation system, for example, would prefer from two candidates for a playlist the one that has a Slovak composer, or a performer from Wales, or which has Farsi lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Demo App creates recommendations on the basis of a pre-existing radio or personal streaming playlist that, by choice, contains a pre-defined ratio of music produced in Slovakia, or performed by Slovak artists. We will soon add Dutch and Hungarian choices to this demo, but naturally, we could add any city&amp;rsquo;s, regions&amp;rsquo;, province&amp;rsquo;s our countries preferences into the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Demo App and accompanying Feasibility Study in Slovakia shows how can a regulator create better broadcasting regulations, learning from the experience with AI-driven streaming platforms, and how can it apply the goals of local content requirements (such as a certain visibility for Slovak or a city-based music) and public service requirements (for example, spreading reliable information or stopping &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-30-racist-algorithm/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;hateful music&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;access-for-all&#34;&gt;Access for all&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not believe that the current heated discussion on the re-regulation of AI and music streaming will solve all the problems of independent artists, bands from ethnic or racial minorities, or otherwise vulnerable producers. New regulation can limit the unintended collateral damage of big data algorithms deployed by big corporations, but they will not bring down the benefits of AI to these creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the example of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/03/spotify-artists-promote-music-exchange-cut-royalty-rates-payola-algorithm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt; new initiative that let&amp;rsquo;s artists, labels and publishers to promote their music in exchange for &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-11-02/amplifying-artist-input-in-your-personalized-recommendations/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;a cut in royalty rates&lt;/a&gt;. While felt by many artists injust and even corrupt, it is an answer to the growing need to influence how the recommendation algorithms are promoting certain music at the expense of tens of millions of sound recordings that are not recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that algorithms create value for the users, and if artists are not happy to pay for corporations to influence black box algoritms, thatn they must collaborate and share data, and build large enough data pools so that they can deploy white, transparent algorithms that work for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Feasibility Study shows why it is important that creators have a &lt;code&gt;control over what data describes their music&lt;/code&gt;, their biographies and other information online, because corporate streaming platforms use this information for their algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should that with relatively little effort creators can &lt;code&gt;pool enough information&lt;/code&gt; to create alternative recommendation systems that follow a more agreeable goal, that is sensitive to local content requirements and more access to new artists, women or black performers, or which suppress hateful lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit of an &lt;code&gt;open algorithm&lt;/code&gt; and pooled data is that artists can actively look for audiences in various age groups or in cities that are accessible for them on a performing tour after the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, we want to show that regulating black box, private algorithms and data monopolies is only a first step to damage control. Deploying white, transparent algorithms and building collaborative or open data pools can only guarantee fairness in the digital platforms, in recommendations, and generally in the use of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/tag/listen-local/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; is developing transparent algorithms and open source solutions to find new audiences for independent music. We want to correct the injustice and inherent bias of market leading big data algorithms. If you want&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;your music and audience&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;to be analysed in Listen Local, fill&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ll_collector_2020&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;in.

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interview with Utrecht recording artist, performer, composer, and producer Stefan Breuer, manager of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tinyroom.nl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tiny Room Records&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For fans browsing the city after a given show, what do artists in Utrecht recommend as far as things to see, do, listen to, or other advice for visitors?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone checking out one of my shows in Utrecht, I definitely recommend a walk around the city if they have some down time. Nearby our space, one can stop at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.deklub.nl/menu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;De Klub&lt;/a&gt; for a bite to eat, the local brewery &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dekrommeharing.nl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;De Kromme Haring&lt;/a&gt; for a beer, or the record store / coffee bar Koffie Leute around the corner. For those with more time during the day, I also recommend a few local record stores like Dig It or Plato or maybe a walk around Utrecht centre. For the full Utrecht experience, I recommend a dive into the postrock, slowcore, indiefolk vibes of this friendly city with bands if you can catch bands like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thefireharvest.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Fire Harvest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.iamoak.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;I am Oak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://homemadeempire.bandcamp.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Homemade Empire&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tinyroom.nl/artists/this-leo-sunrise/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;This Leo Sunrise&lt;/a&gt;, among others. And of course there’s the Nijntje Museum, the Dom tower, and the canals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where do your artists hope to play next year? Where do they hope to find new fans?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I’d like to play in any city with a vibrant DIY scene. In the Netherlands, I’d like to rebook all the shows in Haarlem, Amsterdam, Eindhoven and in Liège (BE) that were cancelled due to COVID. I’d also like to add some shows in Groningen, Nijmegen, Enschede, Maastricht and Arnhem because I know they also have some small DIY scenes there, too.&lt;/p&gt;

      Stefan Breuer / Tiny Rooms.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to play in any city with a vivid DIY scene. In the Netherlands, I&amp;rsquo;d like to re-book our shows that were all cancelled in Haarlem, Amsterdam, Eindhoven, and Liège. I&amp;rsquo;d like to add some shows in Groningen, Nijmegen, Enschede, Maastricht and Arnhem because I know they have small DIY scenes there too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you and your artists see the role of YouTube, Spotify, Facebook, algorithms, big data?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We try to make sure all our bands are present on all of these platforms and actively engage with content as much as possible, but there’s not really enough time to get the most out of YouTube, for example, when you are also trying to write and record music, book shows, not to mention that artists involved with my label all have other work and families to be with. I’d say we all know the potential of the internet and big data, but the best we can do right now is just let as much happen with that as we can. We don’t really feel like we have any control over what happens in that area or our overall “success” on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How much is your label really focused on Utrecht specifically? Where would you say the true home base of your label is, whether geographically or spiritually? Where do you have the strongest audience?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Tiny Room Records is actually based in Utrecht and Bilthoven. Utrecht is a city. That’s where the scene happens and that’s what we’re part of. I live in Bilthoven, which is 5 kilometers away from Utrecht. It’s next to the woods. It’s quiet. It’s small. It’s perfect for focusing on creating beautiful music and art. There’s inspiration from the sight and smell of nature and not a lot of distractions like pubs and venues. So as a musician, my home base is Bilthoven. Running a label, it’s Utrecht because all the shows, recordings, and rehearsals happen there. It’s also where we’ve held most of the Tiny Room nights, and our 5th year anniversary festival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How important is touring for your label’s roster? How do artists select touring locations? Where do you think your label’s strongest potential for finding a new audience would be?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our rehearsal space and venue Studio Patrick generates a DIY scene which is unique for Utrecht but not necessarily Europe. In the NL, we’ve always had a strong connection with Subblicious in Leiden, Lepel Concerts in Groningen, Roodkapje in Rotterdam, Vondelbunker in Amsterdam, Katzwijm Studio in Voorhout, De Ruimte in Amsterdam, the art scene around Danielle Papenborg in Nijmegen, and the Van Onderen festival. We’re also connected to labels like Subroutine, Moving Furniture, Snowstar, Coaster, Narrowminded, Geertruida and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/64MRjQF17SHJPX17Zsx42d&#34; width=&#34;710&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use these contacts to set up tours and other possibilities long the way. Sometimes it doesn’t work out wen you have a Canadian artist playing for two people in Heerhugowaard, but you don’t know until you try. That’s how I stumbled upon the scene around &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/honesthousemusic&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Honest House&lt;/a&gt;, a label and booking agency in Liège, Belgium a couple years ago. It turned out to be perfect for all our bands and we still maintain a good partnership with them in order to regularly produce a few nights of live music. We will start working with them again around live music, of course, when we are post-COVID. Same goes for &lt;a href=&#34;https://lousymoon.bandcamp.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Lousy Moon Records&lt;/a&gt; in Köln. I think there are a lot more places like this and it would be great to have more insight about where the super DIY/indie/arty/folk/postpunk/kraut/experimental songwriting stuff is happening. I know it’s there in a lot of cities in its own form, but the audience is so small that it’s hard to get to know all the cool places. I’d like to focus on NL, Belgium, Germany, and France since these areas are the most doable for a weekend or week long tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s more important? Belonging to a scene, a genre, a subculture, or a location? How are these connected?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, it’s important to belong to a scene. These are the people here in Utrecht that care about what we do, our shows, and our releases. They come to support the bands, have a great time, and we all know each other, have the same values, and we’re good friends, too. Maybe some call that a “subculture” too, but no one I know calls it by a particular name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need a location to get together, but you can build a scene anywhere, I guess. My dad even built a vibrant music scene in the middle of nowhere in France in a village of 200 people. About genre, I don’t want to focus on one thing. For the label, I have a specific thing in mind — music that I really love — which is based on my own taste. Most people at the shows we host are most interested in music that’s more experimental, unique, even a bit raw and unusual. I can be ambient, indie rock, punk, sloppy folk, doom songwriters, slowcore, noise, etc. If it’s too catchy or a “normal” radio friendly singer/songwriter, the audience scratches their heads and I won’t have a good time either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What kind of insight and intelligence would you like from Listen Local, which tries to crunch a lot of data about location, language, and the genre of small acts?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to know where similar scenes are in other cities, where they host shows, and who books them, mainly in the Netherlands and surrounding countries, but also possibly in Italy, Switzerland. The bonus is that this also gives me some cool new bands to listen to as well. They would probably have a good audience here in Utrecht and we could probably do a “gig swap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally it would make booking easier so that you won’t have to reinvent the wheel each time and hunt for new places, although that can also lead to some great adventures and memories, so I would not rule that out entirely. About genres, I hope to find bands that look beyond genre and experiment with sound, culture, and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reproducible research in practice: empirical study on the structural conditions of book piracy in global and European academia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;PLOS One&lt;/a&gt; is the fourth most influential multidisciplinary journal after Nature, and Science, and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php?category=1000&amp;amp;area=1000&amp;amp;order=h&amp;amp;ord=desc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;H index&lt;/a&gt;.) On December 3, 2020 it published &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242509&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; co-authored by Dr. Balazs Bodo, associate professor at the Institute for Information Law (IViR), Daniel Antal (Reprex, Demo Music Observatory), a data scientist interested in reproducible research, as an independent researcher, and Zoltan Puha, a Data Science PhD at Tilburg University, JADS. PLOS (Public Library of Science) is a nonprofit Open Access publisher, empowering researchers to accelerate progress in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article utilizes the our reproducible datasets created with our &lt;a href=&#34;https://regions.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;regions&lt;/a&gt; package, and builds on many years of expertise in empirical research on the field of music and audiovisual piracy, home copying and private copying compensation (see for example &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/publication/private_copying_croatia_2019/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Private Copying in Croatia&lt;/a&gt;.)  Our aim is to provide reliable, high quality indicators for the creative industries not only on national, but provincial, state, regional and metropolitan area level, too, because these levels are often more relevant for creators, performers and policy-makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic of the paper is Library Genesis (LG), the biggest piratical scholarly library on the internet, which provides copyright infringing access to more than 2.5 million scientific monographs, edited volumes, and textbooks. The paper uses advanced statistical methods to explain why researchers around the globe use copyright infringing knowledge resources. The analysis is based on a huge usage dataset from LG, as well as data from the World Bank, Eurostat, and Eurobarometer, to identify the role of macroeconomic factors, such as R&amp;amp;D and higher education spending, GDP, researcher density in scholarly copyright infringing activities.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      We created a global and a far more detailed European model for pirate book downloads.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main finding of the paper is that open access, even if it is radical, is not a panacea. The hypothesis of the research was that researchers in low-income regions use piratical open knowledge resources relatively more to compensate for the limitations of their legal access infrastructures. The authors found evidence to the contrary. Researchers in high income countries and European regions with access to high quality knowledge infrastructures, and high levels of funding use radical open access resources more intensively than researchers in lower income countries and regions, with less resourceful libraries. This means that while open knowledge is an important resource to close the knowledge gap between centrum and periphery, equality in access does not translate into equality in use. Structural knowledge inequalities are both present and are being reproduced in the context of open access resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is unique not just because of the data it is based on. It also sets new standards in interdisciplinary legal research by publishing the paper, the data and the software code in the same time in open access repositories, following reproducible research best practices &amp;mdash; the practices that we want to promote in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; and further data observatories to serve business, evidence-based policy and scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;

It also sets new standards in interdisciplinary legal research by publishing the paper, the data and the software code in the same time in open access repositories, following reproducible research best practices &amp;mdash; the practices that we want to promote in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Digital Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; and further data observatories to serve business, evidence-based policy and scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;

      Guitarist Jerguš Oravec and singer Tammy Nižňanska
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Youniverse as a band and creator collective was formed in 2015 around guitarist Jerguš Oravec and singer Tammy Nižňanska. Changing genres and forms, creating musical and visual worlds spiced up with BDSM attire they have been playing shows in Slovakia and releasing a full-length album in 2018.  Tammy is a bilingual Slovak, who is more comfortable in the English language due to her upbringing than in the country’s language, and against what she feels to be the expectation of the local audience, she sings in English.  No wonder that she is also looking for ways to expand their universe beyond the country borders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;740&#34; height=&#34;410&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bYsOnmUeLHE&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tammy believes that The Youniverse it at a crossroads.  To be more successful at home, they would have to switch to their native Slovak language, and to be more successful in English they would have to connect better to foreign audiences.  She believes that the local audiences often seek a different quality than what she offers – the purity of her voice instead of auto-tune, or the native language instead of the language of rock and roll. Therefore, their main targets are the Southwestern part of the United States, particularly Los Angeles in California and Austin in Texas, and they believe that their eccentric show would probably create interest in Japan, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do they know or think of big data algorithms? The Youniverse hired a Google Analytics manager and they try to figure out how they could reach out to fans in far away places, or to understand how their songs occasionally find their ways to people in different countries.  Tammy knows that Spotify employs playlist curators who are helped with computer-based algorithms to find new music, but she is not familiar with the process – that is why she volunteered to participate in our Listen Local project and our Feasibility Study for the creation of a Slovakian music promotion service.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Turning Tide: hCaptcha Competes With Big Tech On Privacy And Market Share</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-26-hcaptcha/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Nov 2020 15:10:00 +0200</pubDate>

      <description>















&lt;figure  id=&#34;figure-hcaptcha&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;featured.png&#34; alt=&#34;hCaptcha&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      hCaptcha
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you tried to fill out forms, find product information, you are have filled out many riddles, captchas.  These captchas are there to prevent robots filling out the forms with funny data, steal your email address or to pretend to be human viewers for paid traffic, because who wants to pay for bots visiting the website?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with the captcha business is that until now, Google was the main provider of them, which created an inherent conflict of interests. Google, as the world&amp;rsquo;s biggest advertising agency, has an interest in letting robots viewing advertisements - something that the &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; captchas are supposed to stop.  And Google let&amp;rsquo;s them do it in a small percent of the cases. Those small percent add up to billions of page views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robots learned to fill in captchas, but Google did not fundamentally change the way they work, instead it released its 3rd version, which collects plenty of personal data about the viewer &amp;ndash; an important input again for its advertisment personalization business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And third, but not least, solving captchas became an industry itself.  Human understanding of pictures trains all sorts of AI applications from self-driving cars to medical diagnostics. People who solve billions and billions of captchas for Google actually carry out billions worth work for the advertising giant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Competing with Google and other Big Tech companies seems like a tall order: their monopolistic market power, platform effects and army of highly paid developers are generally considered too powerful to tackle for anyone but other tech giants such as Facebook or Amazon. Our story shows that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be that way - you can beat Big Tech by focussing on privacy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eli-Shaoul Khedouri and Todd Anderson at Intuition Machines &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fastcompany.com/90377406/suspicious-of-googles-recaptcha-heres-a-popular-alternative&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;built up&lt;/a&gt; hCaptha, with an &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt; for humans in three years to rival Google. They created an ethical AI alternative that currently has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hcaptcha.com/post/hcaptcha-now-the-largest-independent-captcha-service&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;15% global market share&lt;/a&gt; in cybersecurity services focusing on privacy and re-inventing a business model, when they are actually paying for large webmasters to host their riddles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you embed their hCaptcha to your website, you will be offered either a cash-out after the recognition work your readers to for them, or you can opt to have the value of this work transferred to a charity &amp;ndash; currently to Wikimedia Foundation. As they write in their blogpost &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hcaptcha.com/ai-ethics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;AI Ethics Policy&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; virtually every technology, from pencils to dynamite, is a dual use solution; it can be used for good or ill. Every company researching, building, or selling dual use solutions has an obligation to consider the consequences of their actions.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katarzia, or &lt;em&gt;Katarína Kubošiová&lt;/em&gt;, is a Slovak singer, lyricist and producer. In 2020 she released her fourth album &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slnkorecords.sk/en/katarzia/celibat&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Celibát&lt;/a&gt; with the main themes of loneliness and self-appreciation. Album was created in collaboration with the producer &lt;em&gt;Jonatán Pastirčák&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katarzia started her career as a folk singer. In the past years she moved on towards electronic music. She describes her current sound can as a mix of folk and electropop. The tour to promote her newest album &lt;em&gt;Celibát&lt;/em&gt; had been planned for spring 2020, unfortunately due to the Covid-19 pandemic had to be postponed indefinitely. As many other artists, Katarzia thinks that the current situation is not easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the moment, I am not working on any new projects. I am looking for a new job. Once the pandemic is over, I would like to stay where I am now, and return to the clubs to play for my audience. As I sing in Slovak, I know where my place is – I don&amp;rsquo;t want to perform abroad, of course, unless I turn to techno music. On a more personal level, I would like to live in New York – not as a musician, tough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katarzia is originally from Nitra, Slovakia and she has been living in Prague for a couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I live in Dejvice – there is a nice clubroom there, but I don&amp;rsquo;t visit that much. I enjoy going to National Theatre, Dejvice Theatre, Meetfactory, Archa Theatre and Rudolfinum. All the old classics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the restrictions during the pandemic, Katarzia managed to shoot a video for her song &lt;em&gt;Hoří i voda&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Celibát&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;740&#34; height=&#34;410&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xVPDZEa0wjU&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music video is a short film, directed by Jay Walker, an American who lives and works in Prague. &lt;a href=&#34;http://girlsinfilm.net/network&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Girls in film&lt;/a&gt; –- an organization that supports women in the film industry –- participated in the production of the video. The song is about women rights and equality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous albums:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generácia Y (2013)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agnostika (2016)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Antigona (2018).&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Future Audience: Size Of Music Discovery Age Populations In Europe</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-20-music-discovery-population/</link>

      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-20-music-discovery-population/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is various global and national research available on the music discovery demography.  People usually discover new music in their young age as they are forming their own personal identity with their peer group.  This process mainly happens in the school, where similarly aged, educated young people spend much of their day together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music discovery phase is strongly related to the time when most people get their music education: their skills to listen to music, play music or sing, and to compose new music. Investment into music education pays of in later age: people with more diverse music education, for example, with the ability to play music, tend to visit concerts more or discover more music in later life stages.&lt;/p&gt;
















&lt;figure  id=&#34;figure-the-annual-growth-top-chart-and-total-growth-lower-chart-of-the-15-24-years-old-population-in-select-european-countries&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;comparative/music_discovery_population.png&#34; alt=&#34;The annual growth (top chart) and total growth (lower chart) of the 15-24 years-old population in select European countries.&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      The annual growth (top chart) and total growth (lower chart) of the 15-24 years-old population in select European countries.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For practical reasons and supported by academic research, we chose the age group 15-24 as the key age group for music discovery.  We placed the national population of the music discovery age group in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://data.music.dataobservatory.eu/music-society.html#audiences&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music &amp;amp; Society&lt;/a&gt; pillar of the Demo Music Observatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes across Europe are dramatic: in Latvia and the Baltic states, the music discovery age population decreased by 60% since the countries (re-)gained independence in 1991. Musicians and their organizations must work hard in these countries on developing export strategies if they want to maintain the market and audience of their music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some European countries, for example, the Netherlands and Turkey have significantly increased their future audiences. In Turkey this is mainly related to population growth, in the Netherlands to immigration. Countries with a growing young population have a strong position for their music business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all lost in the Baltics and other countries where the &lt;code&gt;music discovery age population &lt;/code&gt; is shrinking.  Much of the lost young population migrated to the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe. If artists and their association in these countries find a way to connect with these new diaspora, their market loss will be far less dramatic. Connecting to the diaspora is the most natural way to start exporting new music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Earlier this year we introduced some in-depth comparison of music audiences in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/audience.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/a&gt;. Central European Music Industry Report.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Twentees: The Mountains Are Higher Next Door And They Understand Our Lyrics</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-18-where-they-understand-us/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2020 08:15:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-18-where-they-understand-us/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Living in their mid-twenties, just got out from the university to the life with the capital L. Having crisis in their workplace, try to find their identity, falling in love or getting heartbroken and anyway, just trying to be happy in this chaotic world. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://twentees.bandcamp.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;twentees&lt;/a&gt; writes their indie-pop songs about the typical issues and problems of the Y-generation, so it is easy to understand when you are in the same shoes, what are they singing about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2015 the band released &lt;a href=&#34;https://twentees.bandcamp.com/album/sing-dance-cry&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;their first album&lt;/a&gt; in English, partly as a respect to their idols like &lt;em&gt;Editors,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bloc Party&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Vaccines&lt;/em&gt;, but also, because they were a bit afraid to write their lyrics in their native Hungarian. For their second album &lt;a href=&#34;https://twentees.bandcamp.com/album/m-land&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Múlandó&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Transient&lt;/em&gt;
they found their sound in their mother tongue, and kept releasing in Hungarian since 2018. Their next EP is just arriving&amp;hellip; soon. If you ever catch up with them after the pandemic somewhere, don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you do not understand Hungarian, just dance with the catchy rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you should do if you are in Budapest and where to go during the night? What’s on abroad for twentees? Kátya talked with their front man, Balázs Konrád &amp;ndash; or in Hungarian name order, Konrád Balázs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-are-you-coming-from&#34;&gt;Where are you coming from?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually from a town that nobody knows about outside Hungary, called Hódmezővásárhely. Try to pronounce it! Let’s just say we are from Budapest, I live here. Craft beer bars are highly recommended, but the city has pretty great pubs in general. Walking alongside the river on the Buda side offers a great panorama to the city, which includes the best looking parliament building of Europe. For daytime activities, getting on a bike and going to less busy parts, like the Danube banks &lt;em&gt;Római-part&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Kopaszi-gát&lt;/em&gt; are nice, or maybe do some downtown record store shopping. For the night time, cruising around the 6th, 7th, and 8th districts will result in good fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;740&#34; height=&#34;410&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ncAHqleHLX4&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-are-you-heading-to&#34;&gt;Where are you heading to?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Romania, particularly in the direction of Oradea, Cluj Napoca, Timișoara, because there are lots of people interested in checking out their Hungarian friends from the other side of the border and because their mountains are lovely. Bratislava and any towns with a relevant Hungarian-speaking population in Slovakia, for the same reason mentioned before, and because their mountains are also nice. There’s Serbia, too, with towns like Senta, Subotica and Novi Sad, where I was born: the local audience is the most grateful one I’ve ever seen, they are really curious for new music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we sing in Hungarian, we try to target regions where our songs can be understood, and of course it would make no sense to go and play in Berlin with our lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/tag/listen-local/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; is developing transparent algorithms and open source solutions to find new audiences for independent music. We want to correct the injustice and inherent bias of market leading big data algorithms. If you want&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;your music and audience&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;to be analysed in Listen Local, fill&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ll_collector_2020&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;in. We will include you in our demo application for local music recommendations and our analysis to be revealed in December.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Who Is Not Recommended On Spotify?</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-17-recommendation-analysis/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Nov 2020 11:03:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-17-recommendation-analysis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are analysing how recommendations work for the artists involved in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/listen-local/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; experiment. We created a testing database with their music and other artists from their cities, regions and countries. We need new recommendation engines to dig out from a pile of international hits the local artists.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Avoid landing on &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-24-forgetify_pop_october/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Forgetify&lt;/a&gt;, in the universe of never listened-to-songs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input checked=&#34;&#34; disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Understand how artists and their songs can find audience in the region relevant to their career goals, tour destinations, export opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our preliminary analysis is not representative for nationality, though we believe that we will find serious regional, linguistic and national patterns. We are using examples from Spotify. To be fair to Spotify, while their algorithm has many problems, their API is at least very open, as opposed to Apple Music where we do not really know what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our main concern is that some artists and their songs seem to be never recommended. Moreover, if artists and songs from a city, region or country are rarely or never recommended, then they risk losing their home market: the local audience will be recommended music that is coming outside of the city, region or country.&lt;/p&gt;
















&lt;figure  id=&#34;figure-artist-has-more-related-artists-as-number-popularity-and-number-of-followers-grows-nationality-may-affect-related-artists&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;streaming/spotify_related_artists_corrplot_no_title.png&#34; alt=&#34;Artist has more related artists as number popularity and number of followers grows. Nationality may affect related artists.&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Artist has more related artists as number popularity and number of followers grows. Nationality may affect related artists.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important way recommendations work is via &lt;code&gt;related artists&lt;/code&gt;. If an artist has &lt;em&gt;no related artists&lt;/em&gt;, it is very unlikely that either via user browsing interaction or via the algorithm that artists or her songs will be discovered by anybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want &lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;your music and audience&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to be analysed in Listen Local, fill out&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ll_collector_2020&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. We will include you in our demo application and our analysis to be revealed in December.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because big data algorithms learn from user behaviour, more popular, more often selected songs, and songs selected by more users are more likely to be recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
















&lt;figure  id=&#34;figure-the-algorithm-can-learn-more-about-popular-music-because-the-song-is-more-often-selected-by-a-larger-number-of-people&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;streaming/spotify_related_artists_popularity.png&#34; alt=&#34;The algorithm can learn more about popular music, because the song is more often selected by a larger number of people&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      The algorithm can learn more about popular music, because the song is more often selected by a larger number of people
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the algorithm finds more related music, it means that it &amp;ldquo;learned&amp;rdquo; the repertoire of the artist. Artists with very little popularity tend to be related to 20-30 artists, but at a popularity level of 40-60 they are related to 30-40 artists. Seems simple, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that much. If you want the algorithm to learn your music well, you really have to go &amp;ldquo;viral&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
















&lt;figure  id=&#34;figure-artist-with-less-than-1000-followers-risk-not-being-to-recommended-at-all-doubling-your-chances-to-be-discovered-requires-1000x-more-followers&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;streaming/spotify_related_artists_followers.png&#34; alt=&#34;Artist with less than 1000 followers risk not being to recommended at all. Doubling your chances to be discovered requires 1000x more followers.&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Artist with less than 1000 followers risk not being to recommended at all. Doubling your chances to be discovered requires 1000x more followers.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doubling your routes to being recommended via other artists&amp;rsquo; music requires exponential growth.  You need to have &lt;code&gt;1000x&lt;/code&gt; more followers to double the routes leading to your artist profile and recordings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have shown, the current recommendation engines are re-enforcing the existing status quo, and they can &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-30-racist-algorithm/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;re-enforce the marginal status&lt;/a&gt; of subcultures, artists from a nation, city or region. In other words, as we often say, &lt;code&gt;big data creates injustice&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; for larger organizations and with our &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/listen-local/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; analytics and recommendations for artists, managers and labels, we want to fight exactly this injustice. We are creating &lt;code&gt;transparent&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;open source&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;responsible&lt;/code&gt; tools and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Feasibility Study For The Establishment Of A European Music Observatory &amp; The Demo Observatory</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-16-european-music-observatory-feasibility/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2020 07:03:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-16-european-music-observatory-feasibility/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/a756542a-249d-11eb-9d7e-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-171307257&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Feasibility study for the establishment of a European Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; was published on 13 November.  Our private observatory, CEEMID was consulted in the creation of the Feasibility Study, and some of our recommendations found way into the consultant’s document. We created a Demo Music Observatory to provide a practical guidance on the decisions facing the European stakeholders, and to answer the questions that were left open in the Feasibility Study &amp;mdash; particularly on  &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/music-observatory/#data-gaps&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;data integration&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/music-observatory/#organization&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;institutional model&lt;/a&gt;, where a wrong choice can lead to very long delivery time, &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/music-observatory/#quality&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;quality control&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;#budget&#34;&gt;budgeting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been developing our &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/music-observatory/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; in the world&amp;rsquo;s 2nd ranked university-backed incubator program, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-09-25-yesdelft-validation/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Yes!Delft AI Validation Lab&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-09-15-music-observatory-launch/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;15 September 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Our aim is to show a better organizational model, examples of &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-09-11-creating-automated-observatory/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;research automation&lt;/a&gt; and other data integration innovation that can reduce the budgetary needs of the European Music Observatory by 80-90% and provide far more timely, accurate, and relevant service than most data observatories in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEEMID has been creating a similar data observatory to the foreseen European Data Observatory, solely based on the contribution of about 60 European stakeholders.  As the &lt;em&gt;Feasibility Study&lt;/em&gt; suggests, we would be happy to transfer much of CEEMID’s content to the European Data Observatory, which could potentially fill up about 50-70% of the envisioned observatory.  We are building our Demo Music Observatory based on the 2000 pan-European indicators collected by CEEMID since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Challenge Our Demo Observatory&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Check out the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://demoobservatory.dataobservatory.eu/music-diversity-circulation.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music Diversity &amp;amp; Circulation Pillar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;of our Demo Music Observatory.  If you do not find what you are looking for,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/#contact&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; &lt;em&gt;we will try to put the data there from our repositories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Feasibility Study is based on perceived data gaps between data needs of the European stakeholders and data availability. We have shown earlier this year to the European stakeholders that much of these data gaps are &lt;a href=&#34;post/2020-01-30-ceereport/#invisibility&#34;&gt;illusory&lt;/a&gt;. We would like to give about 50 indicators with full documentation, automated, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annual refreshment for free for all music industry users. We would like to challenge the stakeholders to formulate data requests to us and think together on the ways how could the European music industry build a better observatory faster and with less cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Feasibility Study concludes that a “European Music Observatory would require a very significant allocation of funds, beyond what could be currently expected from the possible budget of the future Creative Europe programme”.   While the Feasibility Study provide cost options, or any cost-benefit analysis, we are certain that this is an exaggeration.  Most European data observatories operate with an annual 20,000-200,000-euro subsidy.  We want to show with our Demo Music Observatory what can be achieved with an annual budget of 20,000 euros, 50,000 euros, 100,000 euros or 200,000 euros.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Welsh Music Industry In International Comparison</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-13-wales-comparison/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 13 Nov 2020 07:10:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-13-wales-comparison/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Next week we will introduce a music industry report from Wales. The country is a sub-national part of the United Kingdom from a statistical point view. Making evidence-based policy or market analysis is as challenging as in emerging markets where government statistical services are weak. And the parallels do not stop here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year we introduced a comparison of music audiences in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/audience.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/a&gt;. Central European Music Industry Report. Using our &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/publication/regions_2020/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;regions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/publication/retorharmonize_2020/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;retroharmonize&lt;/a&gt; software, we can re-run the code and compare part so the United Kingdom audience to various European audiences. Creating new, sub-national indicators allow a better market or policy analysis and comparison among small and larger countries. Going to sub-national levels is particularly important in live music, which is mainly a local business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While participation in concerts is similar to Western European nations in England (red) and Northern Ireland (grey), and in Scotland, maybe even to Northern Europe, in Wales we see very different participation rates.&lt;/p&gt;

      Participation in music: concerts
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Wales, concert attendance falls quickly from a promising start, which is similar to Central and Eastern Europe. While the granularity of our data is a bit too low for active participation like playing a music instrument or singing, we see striking differences for Wales, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Wales is part of the UK British Industry, its role is similar to Slovak or the Croatian music industry in many sense.  It is part of a larger entity (Slovakia was part of Czechoslovakia, Croatia part of Yugoslavia, and now they are part of the borderless EU) but in an economically peripheral way. Wales offers less career opportunities for artists and audience, so the most valuable, highly-educated, high-earning audience (which can keep buying more and more expensive tickets) is missing, any many art talents leave to England or beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leaves the &amp;ldquo;supply&amp;rdquo; of music drying, and the sustainability of the live music audience at peril.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2020, Professor Paul Carr of University of South Wales was commissioned by Senedd Cymru – the Welsh Parliament to &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-06-welsh-covid-response/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;create a report&lt;/a&gt; examining the &lt;em&gt;state of play&lt;/em&gt; in the post Covid-19 music industries in Wales. &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/publication/welsh_muisc_industries_2020/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Welsh Music Industries in a Post-Covid World&lt;/a&gt;, featured on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; website, will be presented to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://senedd.wales/en/bus-home/committees/Pages/Committee-Profile.aspx?cid=445&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Culture, Welsh Language and Communications Committee&lt;/a&gt;. We hope that this is the beginning of an exciting cooperation when we can share knowledge between Western and Eastern Europe, and support new, evidence-based policies on a devolved, sub-national level.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Robin Kester: This Is Not Democracy</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-11-listen-local-robin-kester/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 11 Nov 2020 11:10:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-11-listen-local-robin-kester/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Robin Kester is a rising star of the Dutch music scene. She released her first mini-album &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinkester.bandcamp.com/album/this-is-not-a-democracy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;This is Not a Democracy&lt;/a&gt; on 11 September 2020 and received many positive reviews from the press. Despite the pandemic she managed to play several concerts throughout the country, although concerts abroad were cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Utrecht-based musician is planning her first full-length album to be released next year. How is a newly recorded artist handling the Covid-crisis? How is she palnning hear career?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where are you heading to?  What would be a city or city-based scene where you would like to play after COVID and start building your local fan base, e.g. Vienna, Antwerpen, Zürich, or other cities. Why? What attracts you there professionally or personally?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure where I’m heading. I’d like to tour internationally with my music. (But who doesn’t?) I find it very difficult to pinpoint one exact place to start building a fan base. I have always loved travelling in the UK and Ireland and I admire a lot of artists from those countries, but I can’t narrow it down to one specific location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where do you come from? What would you recommend to visit in your hometown for a fan who is coming to see your show? And are there other artists in your area/city that you would like to recommend?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m from the Netherlands and I’m currently living in Utrecht. I’d advise you to go for a nice walk around the city centre, follow the Catharijnesingel and go to a movie during the day in Springhaver or Louis Hartlooper Complex. There are plenty of other artists I’d recommend. Moon Moon Moon for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Could you recommend one of your videos from YouTube or Vimeo?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, I like this one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A longer interview in Dutch: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.parool.nl/kunst-media/robin-kester-ik-ben-niet-dat-meisje-met-die-gitaar~b278dd59/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Robin Kester: ‘Ik ben niet dat meisje met die gitaar’&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;I am not that girl with that guitar&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The idea of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/listen-local/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local Initiative&lt;/a&gt; to create transparent, well-documented recommendations in various apps, music education games, and to make new personal and radio  that work differently from the current streaming algorithms. We do not try to find yet another similar song to user, but we would like to find audience to a song. We want to avoid that new artists are ending up on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-24-forgetify_pop_october/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Forgetify&lt;/a&gt; list, or among hundreds of thousands of artists that the streaming platform algorithms recommend to no-one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are an independent artist, band, label, or publisher, we encourage you to add your very short bio into our database (form &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ll_collector_2020&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to add several bands/artists, get in touch with us and we&amp;rsquo;ll provide you a spreadsheet), and try out our demo application. Our system will be transparent: we try to make big data algorithms work for you, not against you. We want to help you find your audience in the UK or Ireland, like for Robin, or anywhere you want to go after the pandemic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Demo Music Observatory Dataset: Domestic Market Share On Spotify National Charts</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-09-spotify-national-charts/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Nov 2020 18:10:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-09-spotify-national-charts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The conversion to a subscription-based sales model with Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, Deezer, Pandora and similar services was hailed by some to beat piracy and bringing back growth to the recording industry.  However, there are very few labels and artists who actually feel that they are profiting from this conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&#34;https://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/market.html#recmarket&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Central European Music Industry Report&lt;/a&gt; we have shown the paradox of streaming growth: while the streaming market appears to be growing, for the individual rightsholder, artists, or label, neither the volumes nor the revenues show much of a growth.  There are many factors contributing to the fact that for the ‘typical’ artist streaming does not bring revenue growth, and one of them is the increasing competition with the major label released music, particularly from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/CEE_Report_files/figure-html/medianvalue-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;CEEMID-CI Revenue Index for Typical Recordings&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, the user base of Spotify and similar services did not expand at the same rate as the available repertoire, so more and more songs were competing for not so many users, many of them ending up on the never played &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-24-forgetify_pop_october/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Forgetify&lt;/a&gt; list. In other words, competition has been steadily growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Europe, almost everybody would like to get to the U.S. (getting harder and harder) or the UK (getting somewhat more accessible).  Some have a strong market background at home, others lost their home market without gaining foreign markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some smaller markets are somewhat protected from the competition often have low revenues because of the lower subscription fee and slower roll-out of the services. In the first years of the introduction of these services, like in Croatia or Russia this year, it is critically important to use this period to gain experience with holding or increasing local market shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local music industry must find ways to train algorithms, promote local music contain that is relevant for the new audiences who use streaming platforms.  Our &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/listen-local/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local Initiative&lt;/a&gt; aims build new data integrations that can help training data that reverses this trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Music Observatory project is aiming to track all indicators that &lt;em&gt;jointly&lt;/em&gt; determine streaming success: subscription fees, exchange rates, subscription numbers, use hours, levels of competition, typical playing volumes, typical stream prices, and likelihood of crossing borders to export markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our aim with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; is to find a validated business model to bring to light the roughly 2000 indicators collected by our &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/annex.html#ceemid-history&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CEEMID project&lt;/a&gt; for music pricing, AI, licensing, monitoring, grant evaluation, export market targeting and &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/innovation.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;similar uses&lt;/a&gt;. We would like to transfer these data assets to a future  European Music Observatory. We are giving away in these weeks about 50 automatically maintained, well documented, high-quality indicators with history and timely new data publications for potential users and founding partners of the European Music Observatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We placed the following dataset in our observatory, to be refreshed weekly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/plots/spot_nat50_select.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Domestic market share on Spotify National Top 50, select countries&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download the entire dataset in different formats
&lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/music-diversity.html#domestic-market-share---spotify&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/music-diversity.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music Diversity &amp;amp; Circulation&lt;/a&gt; pillar (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/index.html#pillars-of-the-demo-observatory&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;all pillars&lt;/a&gt;) of our Demo Music Observatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We share the view that &lt;code&gt;big data creates injustice&lt;/code&gt;. Organizations that control large amounts of data, for example, the entire listening history of hundreds of millions of people in all major countries of the world, can train algorithms and robots that drive most of the music sales in the world. They can make your investment into a sound recording successful or doomed. They can circumvent or help a local content regulation, reinforce, or disable a national cultural policy goal. We want &lt;code&gt;big data to work for small venues, independent labels, startups, great and undiscovered artists&lt;/code&gt;. We believe that you cannot make a successful album launch, a market entry or introduce a successful cultural policy without large amounts of well processed and correctly analysed data. We want to create a Music Observatory that integrates the small data of many small bands, small labels, small venues, small countries, and mount correct the injustice. Make algorithms transparent and the competition fair.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inquiry Into The Live Music Industry In Wales</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-06-welsh-covid-response/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Nov 2020 08:10:00 +0200</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In July 2020, Professor Paul Carr of &lt;a href=&#34;http://staff.southwales.ac.uk/users/381-pcarr&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;University of South Wales&lt;/a&gt; was commissioned by &lt;a href=&#34;https://senedd.wales/en/Pages/Home.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Senedd Cymru – the Welsh Parliament&lt;/a&gt; to create a report examining the ‘&lt;em&gt;state of play&lt;/em&gt;’ in the post Covid-19 music industries in Wales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;WATCH: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/pcarr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@pcarr&lt;/a&gt; came to give evidence to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SeneddCWLC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@SeneddCWLC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; for our inquiry into Live Music Industry in Wales 🎵 &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/GtrYPOg8iW&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/GtrYPOg8iW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Senedd CWLC (@SeneddCWLC) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SeneddCWLC/status/1185216516201111555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;October 18, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SeneddCWLC/status/1185216516201111555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Click through&lt;/a&gt; to see a short interview with Prof. Paul Carr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music industries in Wales consist of both part-time and full-time stakeholders and  although dominated by live and recording sectors, also comprise of other sub-sectors, and like in other countries that we surveyed in Central and Eastern Europe, many stakeholders in the music industries are freelancers, following &lt;a href=&#34;https://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/supply.html#creators-of-music&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;multi-track careers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Carr&amp;rsquo;s report is particularly interesting for our &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/music-observatory/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; project because the Welsh nation is a part of a larger entity, the United Kingdom, and many important statistical products may need to be recreated for this sub-national level &amp;mdash; something we have been doing with &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-04-16-regional-opendata-release/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;our survey retroharmonization&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://regions.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;regional statistical tools&lt;/a&gt; for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Welsh Music Industries in a Post-Covid World&lt;/em&gt; will be presented to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://senedd.wales/en/bus-home/committees/Pages/Committee-Profile.aspx?cid=445&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Culture, Welsh Language and Communications Committee&lt;/a&gt; later this month, and we will publish the entire report in English and start a discussion around it, too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Racist Music Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-30-racist-algorithm/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 08:10:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-30-racist-algorithm/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We want big data algorithms to work for small venues, undiscovered bands, and all artists coming from diverse walks of life. We often find that big data works against such types of users, and our Listen Local Initiative was designed to change this trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big data algorithms will increase injustice and breach social norms if they are trained on biased data, or if the algorithms themselves are biased — this is why we place so much emphasis on algorithm transparency and input data transparency. Facebook, Apple, and Spotify are often criticized for helping the spread of hate, for example. But how can an algorithm turn racist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Kraemer &amp;amp; Steve Holden reported on BBC recently that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-54613907&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer and YouTube found recently hosting racist music&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; and they removed it after the BBC’s investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Spotify, public playlists and “suggested artist” algorithms make it easier to find extreme content. In some cases, users created playlists that collated songs and bands associated with the National Socialist Black Metal (NSBM) movement, mainly from Eastern Europe and Russia. Anti-Semitism and glorification of the Holocaust is common in their lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can an algorithm become racist?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an algorithm is trained on the tastes and habits of white users, it will less likely recommend Black music (i.e. genres with histories in Black communities such as hip-hop or jazz, or Black artists making any genre of music) to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If music is coming from a Black community (based on genre, location, or artists with a Black identity), a racist algorithm will be less likely to recommend it to white users, according to what the algorithm predicts white users typically listen to and like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the algorithm learns that certain users have listened to and liked music with racist content, it will provide them with more racist material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can replace &lt;code&gt;black&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;white&lt;/code&gt; with any &lt;code&gt;minority&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;majority&lt;/code&gt; group.  Take &lt;code&gt;Slovak&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;American&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;major release&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;independent release&lt;/code&gt;. European independent music makers may feel a minority compared to international majors. The problem with algorithms is that they can ruthlessly reinforce injustice, because they are focused on learning how to do things better, faster, and more — but not in qualitatively different ways — than they were done before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can we do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fight for the removal of inappropriate content from the &lt;em&gt;training set&lt;/em&gt;. If you see any non-English hateful songs on these platforms, let us know, because English-language moderation is just the tip of the iceberg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure that the training sets of the algorithms behind sales or listening recommendations are inclusive. Our  &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/listen-local/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local Initative&lt;/a&gt; is an early beta of a recommendation system that makes sure that locally relevant music gets recommended to locally relevant audiences, and does not need to engage in a David and Goliath fight against international giants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow the external verification of the algorithm and its results. We allow multiple levels of audit for all our algorithms, and we make all critical elements of our data products open source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A few examples that the tides are turning:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Duka’s Mission: Collaborate With Musicians From Every Country On Earth</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-28-duka-mission/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2020 08:10:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-28-duka-mission/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cologne-based musician and film producer,
Damir Bašić aka Duka decided to try to collaborate with recording artists from all over the world in his new project.  Originally from Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, he finished last year putting their former band’s songs into a 40-minute feature film &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvJ0NlAFjCQ&amp;amp;t=1715s&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Delta wave (2019) with English subtitles&lt;/a&gt; and started to look for a new music film challenge.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjcWWrl-DEnNg-qOxRZfRSg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Propeler&lt;/a&gt;, with one Bosnian ‘l’, had to move on with a new drummer, and Duka wanted to find himself a new music project in his new town, Cologne, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is now making a series of songs, where he is the author of all music and lyrics, but he is inviting recording artists from all over the word to make recorded audio and video performances. He gives much freedom to the performing artists to interpret his songs the way they like, and he dreams that one day, when the pandemia is gone, he will be able to perform the entire set live. These songs are released on all platforms that Distroid covers under the name Duka Base (see for example Spotify &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/album/1YX2VxJe0ecWwVvvdY19Jg?si=KbObLWXgR4yCKY0ZBd7DGg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/36cf6MBy60g&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36cf6MBy60g&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Duka Base - Watch Me (feat. Amina Kamran)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duka was initially struggling with the same problem as we do in Data &amp;amp; Lyrics when we try to explain our &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/listen-local/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/music-observatory/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; projects. “It was hard at the beginning to convince artists to take a part in the show, because it was hard to describe the whole idea. After the first show, everything went better, because the artist could see exactly what I wanted from them. Now, the response is way better of course.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it started to go smoothly. “All those artists have had their own home studios, and it went quick and well. But it&amp;rsquo;s a bit harder to record the video, because all the artists with whom I worked are musicians, and not filmmakers. All in all, I am very happy with the willingness of the artists to do it as best they can, and at the end, I am happy with the outcome. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting for me how I talked with everyone the same way I would talk with someone in Cologne. The core of producing something is the same, or at least very similar no matter where you live.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FI2KoWkeR3M&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI2KoWkeR3M&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;#3 DMM Podcast Show / PAKISTAN / Amina Kamran / &amp;ldquo;Watch Me&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of the global ambition, Duka does not make a living from creating music. He has a dayjob as a motion designer at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.denkwerk.com/en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Denkwerk&lt;/a&gt;, which is not connected to his musician career. He just moved to Cologne in 2018, so he is not yet integrated in the scene of the German town while he continues to follow the Sarajevo scene as much he can &amp;mdash; though, of course, his musician friends are as much stranded as anybody else in Europe in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Did We Start The Demo Music Observatory?</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-27-why-start-music-observatory/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Oct 2020 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-27-why-start-music-observatory/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was contacted during the consultation period of the Feasibility Study of the European Music Observatory. That led to an uneasy series of conversations with the consultants of this project, and a very enlightening series of conversations with European civil servants, music industry organizations, music managers and artists.  My main pitch was that every single assumption of this project is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They started from the assumption that there is hardly any data available on the European music scene &amp;ndash; whereas we found while building up CEEMID, errr, a pan-European music data observatory, is that music is one of the most data-driven industries in the world, it is choking in numbers, and the reason why this data is not visible is very different. They were talking about lack of data in fields where we already had about 2000 pan-European indicators ready. (See &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/presentation/ceemid-observatory.html#/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Introducing the CEEMID Observatory, 9/28/2019&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;large self-contained html file, takes time to load into browser&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;big-data-creates-injustice&#34;&gt;Big data creates injustice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music industry is scattered: it has the author’s or publishing side, the recording side, a large live music business and usually a very environment for classical (art) music. Within these segments there are hundreds of organizations in each EU country, and each have their own small or large datasets. The music industry has plenty of data, but it is not integrated, and it is often hidden from organizations that may have a conflicting agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fragmentation of data makes these players easy prey in the era of big data. Companies who monopolise big datasets first and create &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/review-weapons-of-math-destruction/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;weapons of math destruction&lt;/a&gt; in the forms of algorithms that work for them, can take an unusually large share of the money created throughout the value chain. Proprietary, uncontrolled, big data trained algorithms reinforce inequality &amp;mdash; this makes Google’s YouTube, Spotify, but also Netflix in films or Amazon in books so powerful against its competitors, but also against competition regulators or suppliers &amp;mdash; in this case songwriters, video producers, filmmakers, book publishers and authors.  If their algorithm works against a creator, the creator is doomed, because half of the global sales are driven by secret algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;big-data-vs-small-datasets-research-automation&#34;&gt;Big Data vs Small Datasets, Research Automation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of the music industry is not too little, but too much data. Music is drowning in numbers, and it has too little resources to turn much data into valuable information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our concept of the European Music Observatory is to pool enough resources to create value for rightsholders, talent managers, venues, festivals and the entire music ecosystem. Most music organization employ 1-5 people, and even the largest national organization, like collective management organizations, fall under the EU definition of &lt;em&gt;small- and medium sized enterprises&lt;/em&gt;. They do not have data scientists, market researchers, forecasters.  They are small organizations with small research budgets and very little time for researching. Nevertheless, with more than 60 partners in 12 countries we have shown that this is possible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we turned 700 million royalty statements into meaningful indicators about &lt;a href=&#34;https://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/market.html#recmarket&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the price and volume growth&lt;/a&gt; in 20 European streaming markets;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;calculated the value gap and the value of private copying in Hungary and &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/publication/private_copying_croatia_2019/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;helped closing the royalty gap in Hungary and Slovakia by helping collective management to significantly increase their royalty collection;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;digital_gap_2018.jpg&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; alt=&#34;Difference between potential market (household cultural spending) and actual digital music revenues&#34; title=&#34;Closing the royalty gap in Europe&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;helped granting agencies to make more relevant &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/grants/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;grant calls&lt;/a&gt; and designed indicators to measure the impact of their grants;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;started the creation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/listen-local/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;local recommendation engines&lt;/a&gt; that help the circulation of the small nation repertoires or city scenes in Europe or beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music-has-data-but-you-need-a-map&#34;&gt;Music Has Data, But You Need A Map&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scattered industries tend to be riddled with conflicts of interests.  While working with royalty collection management societies in the last 7 years I often saw that songwriters, producers and performers are often fighting each other for slices of the pie that is just too small. That means that national members of CISAC (GESAC in Europe), IFPI, and AEPO-ARTIS often do not share data with each other, although their income is below any legally acceptable threshold. They have individually very rich datasets that in many jurisdictions just never meet. Labels, small publishers are so little organizations that they do not have a data scientist, let alone a dedicated IT person, or even an HR professional to hire the services of data scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were able to collect at least 70% of the information content of the planned European Music Observatory, and far more, than most of the 50 data observatories we examined in Europe, because we took an approach inspired in open source software development: continuous opt-in, opt-out data integration, focusing on the synergies that partners can achieve, instead of aiming at endless discussions and compromises on sharing data. We never take away proprietary data from anybody, we just connect data among partners, and enrich it with open data. We would like to guide the industry from hierarchical database planning to the philosophy of open collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-09-11-creating-automated-observatory/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;automated&lt;/a&gt; most of the research tasks, to make it less costly, less error-prone, and require less labour input.  We can automate most of the data collection, data processing, imputation, validation, documentation, reporting, even some modelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invested into harvesting the vast &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/project/open_data/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;open data&lt;/a&gt; of the European Union and its member states.  In the EU, most taxpayer funded research data is freely available, but at a cost of significant data reprocessing cost. If the data was originally collected to calculate to inflation or monitor tax revenues, it needs to be significantly altered for the music industry to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have found a way to connect many small data sources and open data. We can create big data from much small data, and deploy analytics, algorithms on collective datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Forgetify: Popular Music That Nobody Listens To</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-24-forgetify_pop_october/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 18:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-24-forgetify_pop_october/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you work on recommendation engines, particularly recommendation engines that are different from the ones developed by large media or streaming platforms, you do not want to consider goals and directions that you follow, but also the road where you do not want to end up at all. For me, Forgetify has always been a puzzling and wonderful application, because it shows purely where your artists do not want to end up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://forgotify.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Forgetify&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderful application that is “recommending” you songs that have never been played on Spotify.  Music from artists that has not been played by their fans, their friends or foes, brothers and sisters, children and grandchildren! I use recommendations in quotation marks, because their recommendations are usually based on your taste. Forgetify just picks you a song that has not been played on Spotify ever. (Never been played means that somebody may have started it, but very soon stopped playing the song.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What connects me to Forgetify particularly is their motto: “We love music.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can learn from their website, there are millions of Spotify songs that have been played only partially or never at all. And that is exactly the opposite that our partners want to achieve when they work with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to create several playlists with Forgetify.  All I did is that I took their “recommendation” and put it on a list, then hit next.  I skipped tracks that were not licensed to the Netherlands, or which were not music tracks but spoken words, for example sound recordings of stand-up comedies. Then I put these tracks on three lists&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;something that I felt was appropriate called &lt;code&gt;classical music&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another that is &lt;code&gt;popular music&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and another which is a mix of historical recordings, and other music which I think has such a special audience that it would not make a good mix with the other two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/3Gs4kJzmFiMNMfPAuhmC6P&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Eightsome Reel Pt 1&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;em&gt;Bob Smith&amp;rsquo;s Ideal Band&lt;/em&gt; is a digitalized re-release of the LP re-release of 78&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; records from the 1930s, and it is obviosuly no competitor for a modern classical or pop music track. Even the labels &lt;code&gt;popular music&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;classical music&lt;/code&gt; would call for further explanation, but we&amp;rsquo;ll get there another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;rsquo;s see what we have after removing historical, traditional folk, spoken word and classical music tracks in the supposedly &lt;code&gt;popular music&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ldquo;recommendations&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/1kxZfYZBsDSdWhMVXQMCss&#34; width=&#34;740&#34; height=&#34;410&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly to the use of the the word “recommendations”, the expression of “popular music” is a bit ironic here, because we are talking about music that is anything but popular, at least not on Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First let&amp;rsquo;s make a very short &lt;a href=&#34;#comparison&#34;&gt;comparison&lt;/a&gt; of the current global hits, &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-18-october_playlist/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;a subjective list&lt;/a&gt; that I created for this month and started to use for explaining our recommendations, my &lt;em&gt;Forgetify Pop October 2020&lt;/em&gt; list.  I will follow these songs in the coming years, and will keep adding new forgotten songs to my list. Then I&amp;rsquo;ll reflect on why these songs are &lt;a href=&#34;#forgotten&#34;&gt;forgotten&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparison&#34;&gt;A Quick Comparison&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next comparison uses some musicology and sound engineering
“features” of the songs on the three lists. These characteristics
are themselves recognized by algorithms, and they are used for Spotify’s own recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;october_playlist_comparison_forgetify.png&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything is clear from these boxplots is that there is nothing clear about forgotten songs. The boxplot&amp;rsquo;s box show the typical values of popularity or other features, and the line starting from the box still relatively frequent values.  The long boxes of the Forgetify Pop list show that there are all sorts of music on Forgetify: screechy and not, danceable and not, cheerful and sad. My subjective list is shorter and more pronounced: it contains songs that I found to be a good match to listen together.  The current global hits are less similar than my personal selection, but far more homogeneous than all those millions of songs that end up in the forgotten long tail of the catalogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;forgetify_october_features.png&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the only thing that connects this playlist is that the songs are not classical or world/folk music, and that they are forgotten. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/62y0aOSPRK1rL7lo780cgH&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;This Time&lt;/a&gt; single from 2009 by the Intonated (3 listeners this month, including myself) is heavy guitar music. It is dark. &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/album/6cCHMZdMkfhpebJ0s6rRNR&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Perdido&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;Candido Featuring Al Cohn&lt;/em&gt; album released in 1956 by the
Cándido Camero (6945 monthly listeners) is a cheerful jazz song. It is likely that this song actually has an audience, but not on Spotify. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A1ndido_Camero&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Cándido&lt;/a&gt; was born as Candido de Guerra Camero in 1921 in Havana, and with his 99 years he is one of the oldest living artists on Spotify. He recorded this album almost 40 years before the internet was opened for the public. For his life long achievement in Afro-Cuban jazz he received the National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters Award in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal favorite from the Forgetify Pop list is &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/21nQDfg5BMxp7vGARpOBmo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Groovy &amp;amp; Linda&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;Neon Princess&lt;/em&gt; album released in 1968 by Tom Parrott (39 monthly listeners). It is a nice hippy song with the favorite effect of &amp;lsquo;68, the inclusion of a sitar.  The song is not very good, the sitar and the guitar make a rather chaotic mix, but Tom Parrott (born in 1944, Washington DC, United States) is not forgotten because he was bad. There are many songs on Forgetify that I would like to skip in seconds, but Parott&amp;rsquo;s music can stay with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forgotten&#34;&gt;Why Are Songs Forgotten?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One seemingly trivial reason is the age of the music. The current global hits are very new releases. The songs I curated for this months were released 2-25 years ago, though some of them are featured with newer re-releases on Spotify. Many songs on Forgetify are much older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;october_popularity_age.png&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research and other&amp;rsquo;s research show that people &lt;em&gt;typically&lt;/em&gt; listen less and less music as they age. There are many people who listen to music lifelong, but others do it less and less, or completely drop the habit. And a large majority of the people tend to listen to similar music that she liked in her teenage years. For most young women and men, the music discovery period ends with school,  &lt;em&gt;typically&lt;/em&gt; in some post-secondary education institution. Later, they are no longer together with ther cohort peer-grew, but with people from all age and demographic groups when they work. Very few songs become perennial hits, and most of them lose their audience as the fans are getting older, and drop the habit of listening to music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you make sure that your music will have a healthy audience for many years to come? Make sure that teenagers in your country get access to local music, for example, via the school radios, and by bringing them to local shows. That people have a chance to discover it. Build a large enough audience while your band is active who will stay loyal to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important factor is the country where the music was released. Most of the current global hits come from the United States, and some from the United Kingdom, South Korea, Germany and Russia. My personal selection included the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.deus.be/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;dEUS&lt;/a&gt; from Antwerpen, Belgium, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.davidkitt.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;David Kitt&lt;/a&gt; from Dublin, Ireland, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theharmaleighs.com/home&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Harmaleighs&lt;/a&gt; Nashville, TN, are Americans who were released by
Nettwerk Music Group in Vancouver, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;country_of_origin_forgetify.png&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forgotten tracks come from all over the world.  Many of them are Americans, because the US has the biggest recording industry and recorded far the most songs in the last 100-120 years. But on Forgetify my first 50 finds contained songs from Brazil, Finland, France, India, Palestine and Spain, not to mention plenty of classical recordings made all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify has a global audience, but it&amp;rsquo;s main audiences are in the US, Japan, South Korea, Germany and the United Kingdom.  It&amp;rsquo;s algorithms are trained to serve these audiences, and its new content is coming from these countries. And it recommends very goods songs from these places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because concert and festival promoters, and even radio editors are often basing their decisions on YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music followers, streams and likes, the global platforms may make it extremely difficult for niche genres (for example, ancient or classical music), or small nation artists (such as Slovaks, Belgians) or older artists to get heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally do not believe that it is entirely the platform&amp;rsquo;s fault. Our &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/listen-local/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local initiative&lt;/a&gt; is aiming to use these platforms better, and find global audiences for great music made in small nations and small towns, or niche genres.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Listen Local: Open Collaboration Experiment &amp; Feasibility Study</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-19-listen-local/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Oct 2020 18:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-19-listen-local/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Big data creates injustice.”&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; Cathy O&amp;rsquo;Neil, author of &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/review-weapons-of-math-destruction/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Weapons of Math Destruction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can train machine learning algorithms on millions of music fans, then you can very precisely find listeners in Bratislava, entire Slovakia, in the Slovak diaspora in the United States.  In Utrecht, in Flanders, in Japan. If you cannot, then your sales will be driven by Spotify, Apple, Amazon or Google’s YouTube. And you fill compete with millions, tens of million of songs in your own city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have access to the entire analytics toolkit to fine-tune your mastering, your instruments, your tempo, when you know how to plug into the radio editors pre-screening, then you have chance for airplay. If you are all small, even local content guidelines, such as national radio quotas or public radio targets will not help you, because you remain invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the support of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://sgda.sk/#about&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Slovak Arts Council&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.soza.sk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SOZA&lt;/a&gt;, non-profit civic association representing more than 2,600 rights holders in Slovakia and over 1 million abroad (musical works composers, lyrics and publishers), and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ci-info.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Consolidated Independent&lt;/a&gt;, a music distributor platform &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/company/reprexbv/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Reprex&lt;/a&gt; is preparing a feasibility study for the collaborative, transparent research tool and application that helps you to find your way to radio playlists, connect to fans in your own city, country, and in other towns along viable tour routes.  Make music export more of a science than a guessing game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;listen_local_mindmap.png&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first step, &lt;em&gt;until the end of 2020&lt;/em&gt;, we are going to create a demo application and a feasibility study with quantitative musicologists and data scientists. The demo application will show how to use AI to place the music of the volunteering bands and labels’s repertoire on radio lists and personal playlists.  Our feasibility study will show how different local content guidelines (radio quotas, public broadcaster targets, and other tools) can affect the market share of small local and national repertoires, and will provide culture policymakers and competition authorities with insight how to make the algorithm-driven music streaming, broadcasting marketplace more even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-can-you-participate-in-the-experiment&#34;&gt;How can you participate in the experiment?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first phase of the experiment, &lt;strong&gt;only artists and their groups released on Spotify&lt;/strong&gt; can participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participation in the experiment is free&lt;/strong&gt;.  The research findings, including potential targets for your music, will be fully open, transparent and free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are an artist, you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ll_collector_2020&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;simply fill in a form&lt;/a&gt; identifying your music on Spotify, filling in a few biographical data about yourself (or your band, ensemble, group). We do not ask any financial data, and only very limited personal information. We only ask about city affiliations, targeted cities, age, experience level, and language of your lyrics, if you do not play instrumental music. In our experience, these factors are very important among musicology and sound engineering quality measures. (Read a bit more about our data &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/listen-local/#data-use&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;data use&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a &lt;strong&gt;fan of independent music&lt;/strong&gt;, please, &lt;strong&gt;forward this post&lt;/strong&gt; to a band that you would love to see in our project, or a local music venue that you would like to visit again after the covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;october_playlist_analysis.png&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our project originally started out of Slovakia, Hungary, Czechia and Poland, but we only found funding in Slovakia for a low-budget, open source, open data, open collaboration experiment. &lt;strong&gt;Participation is open anywhere in the world&lt;/strong&gt;, but we are &lt;strong&gt;focusing on a viable post-covid tour route&lt;/strong&gt; around Budapest – Bratislava – Vienna – Salzburg – Munich – Ruhr – the Netherlands – Belgium. We hope to give guidance on targeting both recorded and live music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you represent several artists&lt;/strong&gt; as a talent manager, music publisher, record label, granting agency or music export office, please get in &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/#about&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;touch with us&lt;/a&gt; for onboarding. We will ask you to contribute a small sum on a crowdsourcing basis to expand our experimental project, but the small financial contribution is not a mandatory requirement. (See budget and &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/listen-local/#transparency&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;transparency&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>October Playlist: Wounded Egos</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-18-october_playlist/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Oct 2020 18:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-18-october_playlist/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every month I create a playlist for my friends and myself – a habit that I have started with mixtapes. This month reflects our team’s journey into one of the world’s most prestigious &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-09-25-yesdelft-validation/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;startup validation
lab&lt;/a&gt; in the AI field, in a year when the recession is deeper than ever since the World War 2, the music business is devastated by the pandemic, and our team is forced to lockdown, follow this excellent validation lab on Zoom screens, meet our first clients online, and learn to work together in a socially distanced way. The songs I chose are subjectively important to me, a bit maybe even controversial ones, and probably very different from the music that you are listening to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to use this example as a start of series how we are
thinking about connecting musicians and their fans in new ways with the help of AI and big data. How we are planning to bring back life to the small venues after the pandemic? How we try to keep the link between musicians and their audience alive in this very sad year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;october_playlist_analysis.png&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this chart you can see a short analysis of my &lt;code&gt;Wounded Egos&lt;/code&gt; playlist. It is a very personal, subjective playlist. Subjectivity is very important to us, because we want to use the
insights from big data and machine learning in a very personal way to
the music community: fans, artists, technicians, managers, labels,
publisher and all the ecosystem. You can play my playlist in Spotify’s embedded player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below the music player you find a very short &lt;a href=&#34;#comparison&#34;&gt;comparison&lt;/a&gt; of the current global hits and the current hits in the Netherlands on Spotify. This time I would like to illustrate the difference of my listening habits from the global mainstream, and I won&amp;rsquo;t go in depth to how we want to make more relevant recommendations. These are the difference that we are trying to capture for local music scenes, cities, countries in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/listen_local/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you find it interesting why I chose these songs in October 2020, you read about &lt;a href=&#34;#october-playlist&#34;&gt;my choices&lt;/a&gt; as a personal recommendation at the end of the post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparison&#34;&gt;A Quick Comparison&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My playlist is a very subjective and curated playlist&amp;hellip; (&lt;em&gt;I curated it myself, after all!&lt;/em&gt;) These songs are very different from the songs that people are more likely listening to around me in the Netherlands, or all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My subjective list for October 2020&lt;/strong&gt;: 1. &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/14LSfvkF3PS0k81FAe6PFk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wounded Egos&lt;/a&gt;  -  2. &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/3MKXdtTufdX4BwVbuJqFGW&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Sirens&lt;/a&gt;  -  3. &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/3A8ZDfxmb75kFl5Cqr2pIf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Panic&lt;/a&gt;  -  4. &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/3ezOmKfYasIe0QeWyWiucU&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t Stop&lt;/a&gt;  -  5. &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/2rvxQwn7rGR0ZmHvwP4AmG&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Michael And Heather At The Baggage Claim&lt;/a&gt;  -  6. &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/6Uhhwk8oJc8SLloZIAQksB&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Machinist&lt;/a&gt;  -  7. &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/7lBpCteEdS5WbOnzbVmWiR&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Royal Screw Up&lt;/a&gt;  -  8. &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/49UDOG8DoBajXTJSTqfRMg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Kyoto&lt;/a&gt;  -  9. &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/0qZ9rwAonJvO91GK9nqqma&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Yours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Chance The Rapper)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The most streamed songs in the Netherlands overlap with the most streamed songs all over the world, but there is no overlap with my list.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our aim is to create locally relevant recommendations. If you live in
Antwerpen, and you are looking for bands that you can see on a small
stage after the pandemic, we will recommend you great music from
Northwestern Belgium and the South of Holland. If you want to visit San Diego after the pandemic, we’ll recommend you music from the San Diego scene. If you want to fill up with good music a local content quota, such as a national and city relevant quota in your radio, we will help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next comparison uses some musicology and sound engineering
“features” of the songs on the three lists. These characteristics
are themselves recognized by algorithms, and they are used for Spotify’s own recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;october_playlist_comparison.png&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34; /&gt; My songs
are independent songs, far less popular than the global hits. My
playlist is mainly indie rock, so far less danceable, less loud than the current hits, but it is more energetic! The average tempo is similar to the hits, but I tend to chose slower songs, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify’s &lt;code&gt;valence&lt;/code&gt; is a quantitative measure that aims to capture the
positiveness conveyed by the a sound recording(e.g.happy, cheerful,
euphoric on the positive side, and sad, depressed, angry on the negative side). Another striking difference among my list and the two hitlists is the far broader scale of emotions conveyed by the songs that I selected for October 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next blogposts we will explain some details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;october-playlist&#34;&gt;Wounded Egos: Daniel’s October Playlist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Gaz Coombes - &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/14LSfvkF3PS0k81FAe6PFk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wounded Egos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting up a company, building a team in the times of corona, social
distancing, zoom calls and narcissistic world leaders is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. dEUS - &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/3MKXdtTufdX4BwVbuJqFGW&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Sirens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;“You gotta pick your fights, you’ve got work to do”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which makes you think that you have to resist the Sirens call. This
record came out the day before I went to my CFA exam, which was the most gruelling test in my life. I just downloaded it, put it on the car hifi, pressed play and did the 8 hour test without error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Harmaleighs - &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/3A8ZDfxmb75kFl5Cqr2pIf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Don’t Panic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But what if that’s all I’m good at?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t Panic surprised me so much that it found its way to my September
and October playlist, too. If something is perfect, it is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon Spencer Blues Explosion - &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/3ezOmKfYasIe0QeWyWiucU&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Can’t
Stop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I just can’t stop”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I need to go back to the basics. Jon Spencer is as good as
Elvis must have been on stage. I never saw Elvis on stage, I am too
young for that, but old enough to have seen Jon Spencer on a large and
small stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fountains of Wayne - &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/2rvxQwn7rGR0ZmHvwP4AmG&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Michael And Heather At The Baggage Claim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Michael &amp;amp; Heather at the baggage claim tired of playing the waiting
game”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The covid pandemic not only froze the entire music industry, and put
many artists, venues, managers, technicians on life support, but claimed many lives in the audience and in the music community. I still come to tears when I recall that early March day when I learned that Adam Schlesinger, my favourite lyricist and songwriter died. I was alwayshoping that I will show him what we were doing. We will certainly dedicate something to his memory along the way. For 15 years, when I was sad, I just picked one of the Fountains of Wayne records, and put it on. For this playlist, I chose a bittersweet song, which probably has the best poetry written in independent music ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify falls for the typical Schlesinger trick: the melody is very
upbeat, the lyrics is bittersweet. Spotify risks to put it into the
positive and danceable category, at least, within my list, though I find it just a bit less gloomy than &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/3A8ZDfxmb75kFl5Cqr2pIf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Don’t
Panic&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/7lBpCteEdS5WbOnzbVmWiR&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Royal Screw
Up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Japanese Breakfast - &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/6Uhhwk8oJc8SLloZIAQksB&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Machinist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“How can I fight a kingdom of your demons?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t complain about the big algorithms of the big company. Spotify’s algorithm brought Japanese Breakfast to me. We just want to take a less individualist approach to making recommendations. Michelle Zauner is on the feminine side of this list, and I just can’t get enough of her music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify’s analysis finds this song to be less danceable and dark, which is exactly why Japanese Breakfast is such a curious artist project. It is experimental pop music that twists well-known pop clichés into original new songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soccer Mommy - &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/7lBpCteEdS5WbOnzbVmWiR&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Royal Screw Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“And I want an answer to all my problems”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Soccer Mommy’s new record came out in March, I could not resist
reaching out to the sound engineering team to convey my congratulations. Soccer Mommy is the youngest artist on this list with a huge talent, and the team that she works with is just world class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phoebe Bridgers - &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/49UDOG8DoBajXTJSTqfRMg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Kyoto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You called me from a payphone / They still got pay phones”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most popular song on the playlist, a true global independent hit.
Phoebe Bridgers is hot, and she &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/groups/155586901702555/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;may be a
killer&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Kitt - &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/0qZ9rwAonJvO91GK9nqqma&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;It’s Yours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify sees this song as the most danceable and most positive song. And it is so.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Governments, the EU, international organizations, and private donors often support causes of public interest with grants and donations. In some cases, these grants are aimed to help starting or sustaining economic activities. In other cases, they are supporting artistic activities or education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/author/daniel/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Daniel&lt;/a&gt; had been involved in the professional assessment of granting schemes and grant applications since 2000. He has learned and taught various assessment methods to evaluated EU and national grants to support valuable public infrastructure, energy savings, health investments and other causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2013 in the CEEMID project he has transferred some of this methodology to supporting music and film creation. Grants are essential to maintain the diversity and artistic quality of European music.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Making Websites Is Not Easy</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-14-making_websites/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2020 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-14-making_websites/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I often find myself in a crossfire between artists and managers who want more transparency and innovation and collective management societies that see themselves as the last stable pillar for music composers, producers and performers to collect their royalties. I was in Bratislava preparing a project with the Slovak societies when a Belgian music professional, Suzanne Verschueren working in the Slovak music industry showed my Moon Moon Moon’s Journal Entry 10. A letter of complaint to the Dutch collective management societies, Buma and Stemra. In a song.  With video animation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtaEKUy6KGE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-14-making_websites/playjournal10.png&#34; alt=&#34;Click on image to play video&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtaEKUy6KGE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Click on image to play video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I immediately contacted Moon Moon Moon, because I had a better laugh at a music industry insider joke, and because I realized that this is one of the many bridges that we need to close if we want to build the European Music Observatory. (See our Demo Music Observatory &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Buma/Stemra reached out to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/moonmoonmoontheband&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Moon Moon Moon&lt;/a&gt; within a day of the release, and within a week they figured out where did the 1500 euro go, apologized for the mistake. The band and the collective management organization have been working together ever since as best friends forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this story is not over.  A year later, the video had less than 1000 views on YouTube.  How is it possible, when the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA58ktFjlFijWiHTbTju4-OnswRmjKTC9&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Moon Moon Moon Journal Entries&lt;/a&gt; are so good?  My &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/team/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;startup team&lt;/a&gt; decided to team up with the MMM collective to figure out how it is possible that with all the might of the artificial intelligence of YouTube’s and Spotify’s algorithms this gem is not world famous yet.  And yes, we are working with a sister society of Buma/Stemra in Slovakia to make this happen, who, in spite of their bad rep among artists, have been fighting with me side by side since 2016 to make this happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to design an app that connects artists and their fans in a better way, using the same might of the algorithms, but working for the small band.  We will re-release the Journal Entries as an album, and we will create algorithms that will find audiences for MMM all over in the Netherlands and Belgium, and in Japan, and probably in many other countries on the way from Utrecht to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw0zYd0eIlk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Kyoto&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Big data creates injustice.”&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; Cathy O&amp;rsquo;Neil, author of &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/review-weapons-of-math-destruction/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Weapons of Math Destruction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Listen Local project is aiming to create better radio playlisting, personal playlisting and concert promotion in a local context: within Slovakia or at a more specific level, Flanders or even the city of Utrecht or Budapest. We aim to place our partner’s music in local radio lists, personal playlists, and grow their fan base during the COVID-19 pandemic so that in 2021 they can eventually meet in the venues again, and carry out longer, more successful tours than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Signing up for artists, labels, talent managers&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#signup&#34;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-problem&#34;&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people are listening to music on Spotify or Apple Music, and at home on YouTube.  They are following advice from algorithms tested on hundreds of millions of people. Anybody can create playlists, but mainly Spotify, Apple, or YouTube create the playlists with their AI algorithms and their staff and their interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-19-listen-local/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local: Open Collaboration Experiment &amp;amp; Feasibility Study&lt;/a&gt; - how you can participate in the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-24-forgetify_pop_october/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Forgetify: Popular Music That Nobody Listens To&lt;/a&gt; - because you do not want to end up on the list of 0 streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-17-recommendation-analysis/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Who Is Not Recommended On Spotify&lt;/a&gt; - you need to have 1000x more followers to double the routes leading to your artist profile and recordings with the current algorithms. We need new recommendation engines to dig out the local artists buried under a pile of international hits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-30-racist-algorithm/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Racist Music Algorithm&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; big data algorithms will increase injustice and breach social norms if they are trained on improper data, or the algorithms are biased. This is why we are working on transparent, peer-reviewed, open source alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-11-listen-local-robin-kester/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;This Is Not Democracy&lt;/a&gt; - Robin Kester is one of the first artists who is looking for alternative recommendation routes towards the UK and Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-18-where-they-understand-us/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Mountains Are Higher Next Door And They Understand Our Lyrics&lt;/a&gt; - the Twentees are flying under the radar in Slovakia, Serbia, Romania, because they sing in a minority language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-18-october_playlist/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;October Playlist: Wounded Egos&lt;/a&gt; - a short case study of a playlist analysis and comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;signup&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Do This Together!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are an artist, you can&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ll_collector_2020&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;simply fill in a form&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;identifying your music on Spotify, filling in a few biographical data about yourself (or your band, ensemble, group). If you represent several artists as a talent manager, music publisher, record label, granting agency or music export office, please get in&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/#about&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;touch with us&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;for onboarding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are aiming to create an alternative market measurement, marketing and recommendation engine tool that is based on open source software, open collaboration, full scientific transparency in an open collaboration with artists, small businesses and the entire music ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;create new playlists&lt;/strong&gt; Let&amp;rsquo;s build up a weekly, relevant, non-exclusive playlists for music coming from Utrecht, Antwerpen, Rotterdam, Den Haag, Flanders or the Netherlands that smoothly blend in local music with relevant, spiritually or musically matching songs that fans of the Utrecht, Antwerpen, Rotterdam, Den Haag bands like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;create apps&lt;/strong&gt;!  If &lt;a href=&#34;https://forgotify.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Forgetify&lt;/a&gt; can pick out songs that nobody, ever, ever listened to on Spotify, not even the performer&amp;rsquo;s mother, sister, friends, not even their enemies, than we can must create new apps that allows fans in Utrecht, visitors or Rotterdam and the virtual community of Den Haag to find relevant music, and to connect with music created in these communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/#about&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;We are&lt;/a&gt; a bunch of musicians, musicologists, music analysts, music journalists, producers who want to make this happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-use&#34;&gt;Data Use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From participating artists we only ask questions that they usually post on their websites or would tell to music journalists or bloggers. We will put all this information (with some clearly stated exceptions in the registration form) on the website of the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use similar data used to analyze &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-18-october_playlist/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this playlist&lt;/a&gt; about the participants&amp;rsquo; music. This data is an analysis of their released music, not about the persons who play the music, or their earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not ask for any financial data, and we do not have access to any financial data of the participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transparency&#34;&gt;Transparency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://listenlocal.community/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; grew out of a large, collaborative project of collective management societies, grant managers, music distributors, venues, and other music stakeholders who joined forces to collect more royalties from 2014 onwards starting with three, and eventually encompassing more than a dozen countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire budget of our project is 10,000 euros, co-funded by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://sgda.sk/about-us/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Slovak Arts Council&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://soza.sk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SOZA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ci-info.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Consolidated Independent&lt;/a&gt;, a distributor of independent music. We hope that this will be enough to create a demonstration and a detailed feasibility study that makes the user needs of Slovak managers, labels, publishers and artists themselves to continue this project in 2021. The project will be carried out by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/company/reprexbv&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Reprex&lt;/a&gt;, a Dutch start-up co-founded by the author of the Slovak Music Industry Report, the first Hungarian Music Industry Report, Private Copying in Croatia, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Central European Music Industry Report 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participation for artists and music venues is &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; in the experiment. In 2020, we would like to find a viable business model that keeps this tool a good value for money for anybody in the independent music scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are asking labels, publishers, talent managers to contribute to our experimental budget on a crowdsourcing basis at a later stage, if they will continue to use this service in 2021. Currently our experiment is free.  &lt;em&gt;Signing up for artists, labels, talent managers&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#signup&#34;&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Product/Market Fit Validation in Yes!Delft</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-09-25-yesdelft-validation/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 Sep 2020 15:31:39 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-09-25-yesdelft-validation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We would like to validate our product market/fit in two segments, business/policy research and scientific research, with a supporting role given to data journalism. Because we want to follow a bootstrapping strategy, we must focus on those clients where we find the highest value proposition, which is of course easier said than done.  We see much interest in our offering from other continents, therefore we truly welcome the opportunity that we can do this on a truly global business canvas in one of the worlds’ &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.yesdelft.com/news/yesdelft-among-the-top-5-business-incubators-in-the-world/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;top five incubators&lt;/a&gt;, the number 2 university-backed incubator in the world, second to none in Europe, in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.yesdelft.com/focus-areas/artificial-intelligence/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Yes!Delft AI+Blockchain&lt;/a&gt; Validation Lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Europe hundreds of thousands of microenterprises, such as record labels, video producers or book publishers are facing data and AI giants like Google’s YouTube, Apple Music, Spotify, Netflix or Amazon. If the recommendation engines of these giants do not recommend their songs, films or books, then their investments are doomed to fail, because about half of the global sales are driven by AI algorithms. When they make a claim for the missing money, they will immediately find themselves in a dispute with gigabytes of data that they can only handle with a data scientist, even though they do not even have an IT professional or an HR professional to make the hire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An awful lot of money, creativity and real values are at stake, and we want to be on the creator’s side, their technician’s side, their manager’s side when they want to get a fair share from the pie and they want to help these industry leader to make the pie grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/creativity/arts-education/research-cooperation/observatories/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; and the EU have been promoting as an organizational solution the fragmentation problem with the so-called data observatories that are pooling the business, policy, and scientific research needs of various domains, like music. This is an idea that we really like, and we believe that our research automation solutions can help these observatories to grow faster as ecosystems, create better quality and more timely data and research products and a far lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We define ourselves as a reproducible research company inspired by the philosophy of open collaboration, based on open-source software and open data. We want to explore various revenue models around these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not committed to open source licensing if more permissive licensing policies provide us with better opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to explore various data-as-service models, because we do not want to be locked into the position of cheap open data vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to deploy AI applications that really help earning money in these sectors with playlisting, recommendation engines, forecasting applications, or royalty valuations, because our open collaboration approach brings up enough data sooner to than its alternatives, because it manages inherent conflicts of interests, fragmentation, and decentralization better than hierarchical solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timeline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January CEEMID reached its peak: we introduced a 12-country &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/post/2020-01-30-ceereport/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;reproducible research project&lt;/a&gt; made with only freelancers in Brussels, presented as best use case of evidence-based policy design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February Daniel visited the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/post/yes-delft-co-lab/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Yes!Delft Co-Lab&lt;/a&gt; to find out who would be the best co-founder to re-launch CEEMID as an enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April we started to &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/post/2020-04-16-regional-opendata-release/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;release our data&lt;/a&gt; as open data for validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One month ago we &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/post/2020-08-24-start-up/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;started-up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we launched the &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;music.dataobservatory.eu&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few other &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/annex.html#other-observatories&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;data observatories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.palato.nl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Palato&lt;/a&gt; in the Hague, where we took our selfie and had an absolutely amazing dinner after the pitch. Check them out!&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Launching Our Demo Music Observatory</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-09-15-music-observatory-launch/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2020 08:00:39 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-09-15-music-observatory-launch/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, on 15 September 2020, we officially launched our &lt;code&gt;minimal viable product&lt;/code&gt; as we promised to partners back in February. This was a particularly difficult period for everybody. We aspired to deliver by September in a very different environment, our hopes for commissioned work went up in flames with the pandemic, and our targeted users, musicians and music entrepreneurs, talent managers, music venues lost most of their income. The organizations helping them, granting authorities, export offices and collective management societies are overwhelmed with the problem. During these troublesome times, our team expanded, attracted great new talent, and kept working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first product is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, a collaborative, automated research-based &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/faq/observatories/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;observatory&lt;/a&gt; for the music industry, one that is particularly hard hit by the COVID19 crisis. Not only great artists, composers, technicians, managers fell victim to the virus, but musicians lost about 50–90% of their income from live music. This translates to a 100% loss for the live music technicians and managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fQJHflWPS34&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

See our &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/post/2020-09-11-creating-automated-observatory/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;earlier blogpost&lt;/a&gt; on what you see on the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music industry was never a place for great job security. For putting up a show, you usually need a network of 10–200 artists, technicians and managers to work together as freelancers without all those social benefits that many people enjoy in other walks of life. We have been trying to figure out how to help this microenterprise and freelancer-network based industry with research for five years. Our aim is to make them competitive when they are talking with their buyers: Google, Apple, Spotify, who are really heavy-weight data and AI pros. Our better plan their tours, when they will be back on the road, to understand what sort of audiences and purchasing power waits for them in different European cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are launching at a time when the music industry is crying for help.Therefore, we have decided to make our demo observatory open and unfinished. Over the last 7 years, we have built up about 2000 music and creative sector indicators to be used for business KPIs, forecasting targets, grant evaluations, royalty valuations, concert demography target group analysis and other professional uses. We would like to open up, based on your needs, about 50 well-designed indicators, and pledge to keep it daily refreshed, corrected, documented, citaable, downloadable. Also, feel free to use our most valuable source code—use it for your own purposes, even modify it, as long as you keep it open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our smaller partners, we follow what musicians do these days on Bandcamp: name your price. We make a pledge to our small partners: if you need reliable data to plan your next grant calls, calculate royalties, compensations, predict hit candidates, give us the job—and name your price. Post-corona, you can take for a dollar the best music from Bandcamp. You can take our research products, for a limited period, for any amount you name, as long as  it is for a good cause and serves the industry, musicians, technicians or managers. In return, we ask for your feedback. Help us validate whether we are on the right track, tell us how we can cooperate after the pandemic, in better times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our larger and better funded partners? We ask you to pay the price we name, because we believe that it is a well-justified, fair and competitive price, set by pricing experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We appreciate it if you take a look at our offering, or if you pass this blogpost on to your colleagues in the industry.  Our main target audience initially are music professional in broader Europe, but we are planning to cover all major global markets very soon, too. Feedback from the U.S., Australia, Canada, Colombia, Brazil &amp;amp; Argentina is particularly welcome as we have great plans over there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-we-are&#34;&gt;Who we are?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/post/2020-08-24-start-up/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; our operations on 1 September 2020 on the basis of &lt;a href=&#34;http://documentation.ceemid.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CEEMID&lt;/a&gt;, a pan-European data observatory that created about 2000 music and creative industry indicators for its users. In the coming days, we are gradually opening up about 50 &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;music industry&lt;/a&gt; and 50 broader creative industry indicators in a fully reproducible workflow, with daily re-freshed, re-processed, well-formatted and documented indicators for business and policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to validate this approach in one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most prestigious university-backed incubator programs, in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.yesdelft.com/yes-programs/ai-blockchain-validation-lab/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Yes!Delft AI/Blockchain Validation Lab&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;re finalist on their selection, and all help before 23 September from our friends in the music industry is more than appreciated. If we get there, we can rely on probably the best pros in Europe to make our offering better tailored and financially sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating An Automated Data Observatory</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-09-11-creating-automated-observatory/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Sep 2020 16:00:39 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-09-11-creating-automated-observatory/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are building data ecosystems, so called observatories, where scientific, business, policy and civic users can find factual information, data, evidence for their domain.  Our open source, open data, open collaboration approach allows to connect various open and proprietary data sources, and our reproducible research workflows allow us to automate data collection, processing, publication, documentation and presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our scripts are checking data sources, such as Eurostat&amp;rsquo;s Eurobase, Spotify&amp;rsquo;s API and other music industry sources every day for new information, and process any data corrections or new disclosure, interpolate, backcast or forecast missing values, make currency translations and unit conversions. This is shown illustrated with an &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/post/2020-07-25-reproducible_ingestion/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fQJHflWPS34&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For direct access to the file visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/video/making-of-dmo.mp4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the video we show automated the creation of an observatory website with well-formatted, statistical data dissemination, a technical document in PDF and an ebook can be automated.  In our view, our technology is particularly useful technology in business and scientific researech projects, where it is important that always the most timely and correct data is being analyzed, and remains automatically documented and cited. We are ready deploy public, collaborative, or private data observatories in short time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data processing costs can be as high as 80% for any in-house AI deployment project. We work mainly with organization that do not have in house data science team, and acquire their data anyway from outside the organization. In their case, this rate can be as high as 95%, meaning that getting and processing the data for deploying AI can be 20x more expensive than the AI solution itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI solutions require a large amount of standardized, well processed data to learn from.  We want to radically decrease the cost of data acquisition and processing for our users so that exploiting AI becomes in their reach. This is particularly important in one of our target industries, the music industries, where most of the global sales is algorithmic and AI-driven. Artists, bands, small labels, publishers, even small country national associations cannot remain competitive if they cannot participate in this technological revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/post/2020-08-24-start-up/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; our operations on 1 September 2020 on the basis of &lt;a href=&#34;http://documentation.ceemid.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CEEMID&lt;/a&gt;, a pan-European data observatory that created about 2000 music and creative industry indicators for its users. In the coming days, we are gradually opening up about 50 &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;music industry&lt;/a&gt; and 50 broader creative industry indicators in a fully reproducible workflow, with daily re-freshed, re-processed, well-formatted and documented indicators for business and policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to validate this approach in one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most prestigious university-backed incubator programs, in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.yesdelft.com/yes-programs/ai-blockchain-validation-lab/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Yes!Delft AI/Blockchain Validation Lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Digital Music Observatory</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/initiatives/music-observatory/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Aug 2020 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/initiatives/music-observatory/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are developing our &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; in the world&amp;rsquo;s 2nd ranked university-backed incubator program, the &lt;a href=&#34;post/2020-09-25-yesdelft-validation/&#34;&gt;Yes!Delft AI Validation Lab&lt;/a&gt;. Our aim is to show a better organizational model, examples of research automation and other data integration innovation that can reduce the budgetary needs of the European Music Observatory by 80-90% and provide far more timely, accurate, and relevant service than most data observatories in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#data-gaps&#34;&gt;Data gaps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#organization&#34;&gt;Organization and institutional model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#quality&#34;&gt;Quality Control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#budget&#34;&gt;Value For Money, Budget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#use-cases&#34;&gt;Use Cases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is power, and &lt;code&gt;big data creates injustice&lt;/code&gt;.  Organizations that control large amounts of data, for example, the entire listening history of hundreds of millions of people in all major countries of the world, can train algorithms and robots that drive most of the music in the world.  They can make your investment into a sound recording successful or doomed. They can circumvent or help a local content regulation, reinforce, or disable a national cultural policy goal.  A country may introduce national artist quotas on radio, if all the youth will be personally recommended foreign songs in their music discovery age in the very same country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that answer of the EU and UNESCO with the creation of permanent data collection points, so-called &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/faq/observatories/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;data observatories&lt;/a&gt; is correct. However, after reviewing 62 data observatories, we are convinced that many data observatories are doomed to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our private observatory, CEEMID was consulted in the creation of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/a756542a-249d-11eb-9d7e-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-171307257&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Feasibility study for the establishment of a European Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, and some of our recommendations found way into the consultant’s document. We created a Demo Music Observatory to provide a practical guidance on the decisions facing the European stakeholders, and to answer the questions that were left open in the Feasibility Study &amp;mdash; particularly on  &lt;a href=&#34;#data-gaps&#34;&gt;data integration&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;#organization&#34;&gt;institutional model&lt;/a&gt;, where a wrong choice can lead to very long delivery time, &lt;a href=&#34;#quality&#34;&gt;quality control&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;#budget&#34;&gt;budgeting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-gaps&#34;&gt;Data Gaps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the feasibility study, 11% of the stakeholders consulted found that sufficient data was available for their work, 30% said that there could be more data but that does not affect their work, and 59% found that the lack of data affects their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have shown in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/publication/ceereport_2020/&#34;&gt;Central &amp;amp; Eastern European Music Industry Report 2020&lt;/a&gt;, featured in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-01-30-ceereport/&#34;&gt;CCS Ecosystems: FLIPPING THE ODDS Conference&lt;/a&gt; – a two-day high-level stakeholder event jointly organized by Geothe-Institute and the DG Education and Culture of the European Commission with the Creative FLIP project.that much of the data gap is &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-01-30-ceereport/#invisibility&#34;&gt;illusory&lt;/a&gt;: the fragmented nature of the music industry, the lack of in-house data expertise create bottlenecks in the use of the data. However, the data is present, and as it is stated in 148-149, we are willing to transfer thousands of indicators in all pillars to the future European Music Observatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Demo Music Observatory is based on the accepted music industry concept in the US and the EU (the three-income stream model) and its data maps that we could apply to emerging markets &amp;ndash; for example, in &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2016-04-20_makk15/&#34;&gt;the case of Croatia&lt;/a&gt;. A clear map of the industry and a clear map of the data reveals that much of the perceived gap is illusory.  We would like to challenge the European music stakeholders to test us, request seemingly missing data that we will try to publish.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This remains a problem with the Summary of Data Gaps on pages 128-131 that enumerate the perceived lack of data for the three pillars.  We believe that these data gaps are in most cases illusory, and the remedies offered in the study are often misplaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streaming activity: the Feasibility Study offers Nielsen’s Global Charts as a potential solution, even though we have shown that this is not the right approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with Nielsen’s charts, or any chart provider’s chart, is that it covers less than 0.01% of the European repertoire, and it depicts a completely irrelevant picture for the 99.99% of the European stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that the right approach, followed by our Demo Music Observatory, is a reconciliation with the work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/content/big-data_en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Big Data&lt;/a&gt; the  European Statistical System (i.e. the partnership of Eurostat and the national statistical authorities.)

&lt;h3 id=&#34;people--diversity&#34;&gt;People &amp;amp; Diversity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Feasibility Study&lt;/em&gt; claims that “there is no real EU wide data on diversity in the music sector.  Diversity should include the study of ethnic minorities, gender and vulnerable groups&amp;hellip;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/comparative/music_activity_playing_an_instrument_by_gender.png&#34; alt=&#34;Illusory data gap: active and music participation is available on EU level both for gender groups or four ethnic minorities – this is regularly featured in various European CAP surveys and in our national CAP surveys, too.&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Illusory data gap: active and music participation is available on EU level both for gender groups or four ethnic minorities – this is regularly featured in various European CAP surveys and in our national CAP surveys, too.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, active and music participation is available on EU level both for gender groups (see our chart) or four ethnic minorities – this is regularly featured in various European CAP surveys and in our national CAP surveys, too.  Our peer-reviewed, open-source &lt;a href=&#34;https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;retroharmonize&lt;/a&gt; statistical software was developed exactly to create these data products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Challenge Our Demo Observatory&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Check out the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://data.music.dataobservatory.eu/music-society.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music, Society and Citizenship Pillar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;of our Demo Music Observatory.  If you do not find what you are looking for,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/#contact&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; &lt;em&gt;we will try to put the data there from our repositories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;music-economy&#34;&gt;Music Economy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because music is mainly a market activity, apart from the mainly publicly funded classical (arts) music sector, and a part of the music (stage) infrastructure, a wide variety of data is available on the music economy in a consistent manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are calling on all partners to challenge us, either on Music Economy or the other pillars of the music observatory. We will try to provide the requested data on a weekly, monthly, quarterly or annually refreshing basis in the highest possible quality – for the first 50 request for free. We would like to demonstrate that most of the data gap is illusory, and a collaborative, bottom-up approach can deliver a European Music Observatory faster, cheaper in a much higher quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Challenge Our Demo Observatory&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Check out the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://data.music.dataobservatory.eu/music-economy.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music Economy Pillar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;of our Demo Music Observatory.  If you do not find what you are looking for,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/#contact&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; &lt;em&gt;we will try to put the data there from our repositories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;organization&#34;&gt;Organization and institutional model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that the biggest shortcoming of the Feasibility Study is a systematic overview of a wide range of organizational possibilities.  The Feasibility Study is illustrated by examples from European Audiovisual Observatory as a good practice, investigates the possibility of integrating the music observatory into the EUIPO Observatory, and as an alternative, it considers the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/farming/facts-and-figures/markets/overviews/market-observatories_en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;six product observatories&lt;/a&gt; of DG Agriculture &amp;amp; Rural Development.  This approach provides a too narrow range of potential organizational alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have reviewed a further 59 observatories, including ones that were not successful and ceased to exist, to understand why some observatories can increase their service level and why others fail. It is unclear what criteria make the European Audiovisual Observatory a good example, so it is impossible to say from this Feasibility Study if there are better examples – and we believe that there are.  The EAO is one of the oldest, if not the oldest observatories. It was created before the EU was founded before the commercial internet launched, when far different legal, governance and data collection needs had to be addressed. We believe that this may be the costliest and most time-consuming model to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bottom-up-versus-top-down&#34;&gt;Bottom-up versus top-down&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Feasibility Study only considers hierarchical and centralized observatories, that operate on a top-down data integration, or rather, simple data collection strategy.  We have created a large observatory  with a very limited budget (which has a public layer, the Demo Music Observatory, and privately funded, much larger version, CEEMID) when we realized that the centralized, hierarchical, top-down approach is not suitable for a fragmented industry like the music industry. The example of CEEMID shows that a bottom-up and collaborative approach requires far less time, budget than a hierarchical approach, and can yield superior data quality. It is not surprising that most of the 62 observatories that we have studied are not hierarchical, and not operated by a centralized body but by a Consortium of various scientific, policy and industry stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;input checked=&#34;&#34; disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; The &lt;code&gt;European Music Observatory&lt;/code&gt; should fully exploit the EU&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;open data&lt;/strong&gt; regime. (See our examples: &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-04-16-regional-opendata-release/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;our first open data release&lt;/a&gt;) Our proposal about this were quoted in the &lt;em&gt;Feasibility Study&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;input checked=&#34;&#34; disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; It should not re-collect data that already exists. Instead it should create policies, synergies and incentives that bring that data to light. The &lt;em&gt;Feasibility Study&lt;/em&gt; partly embraces this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;decentralization&#34;&gt;Hierarchical versus decentralized observatory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;We want big data to work for small venues, independent labels, startups, great and undiscovered artists.&lt;/code&gt; We believe that you cannot make a successful album launch, a market entry or introduce a successful cultural policy without large amounts of well processed and correctly analysed data. We want to create a &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; that integrates the small data of many small bands, small labels, small venues, small countries, and mount correct the injustice. Make algorithms transparent and the competition fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input checked=&#34;&#34; disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; It should not re-collect data that already exists. Instead it should create policies, synergies and incentives that bring that data to light. The &lt;em&gt;Feasibility Study&lt;/em&gt; partly embraces this idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; The observatory must allow a seamless &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/approach.html#dataintegration&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;data integration&lt;/a&gt; between open data, and highly confidential proprietary data. The &lt;em&gt;Feasiblity Study&lt;/em&gt; wants to own and buy data, instead getting access to industry data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; The open collaboration principle must allow an easy opt-in and opt-out for small and larger, public and private organizations, and offer for full transparency for all users. The &lt;em&gt;Feasibility Study&lt;/em&gt; offers a closed observatory without opt-in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;budget&#34;&gt;Value For Money, Budget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that a bottom-up, collaborative approach of the industry stakeholders offers a much faster approach to growth, because it can mange conflicts of interests, build upon existing and trusted data assets.  The &lt;a href=&#34;https://rm.coe.int/budget-19-information-income-and-expenses-of-the-european-audiovisual-/1680952994&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;annual budget&lt;/a&gt; of the European Audiovisual Observatory is about 3.7 million euros.  Most of the European data observatories that we surveyed have an annual budget of 20,000-200,000 euros. In our view, a very comprehensive data observatory can be built from 1-3 million euros and maintained with a collaborative use of existing data assets and a subsidy of up to 200,000 euros a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;quality&#34;&gt;Quality Control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;input checked=&#34;&#34; disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; It should be transparent, the indicator design should be based on open-source statistical software. Our proposal about this were quoted in the &lt;em&gt;Feasibility Study&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; The European Music Observatory must embrace evidence-based &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/approach.html#opa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;open Policy Analysis&lt;/a&gt;. This topic is not considered in the &lt;em&gt;Feasibility Study&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;use-cases&#34;&gt;Use Cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to support the European music industry and our friends in North America, Australia, and all over the world to turn the tables with @ref(innovation) &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/innovation.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;innovation&lt;/a&gt; coming from the open source community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to help you to create alternative recommendation engines that actually recommend songs from your country, and we want to give you very clear export market targets with the help of &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/innovation.html#ai&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt;. Our &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/listen-local/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local Initiative&lt;/a&gt; is aiming to create recommendation engines for cities and regions, and make sure that local bands are recommended to local audiences and audiences in the regions where they will be touring after the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want your evidence to stand a fighting chance against large teams of professional legal and economics teams on the other side with &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/innovation.html#valuation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;proper valuations and damage claims&lt;/a&gt;.  And we want to present all those hundreds and thousands of pages automatically, going through dozens and dozens of automated &amp;ldquo;unit-tests&amp;rdquo; until nobody can find errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want you to be able to prove to your fans, the press, your economy minister that music in many countries has not been at the mercy of the taxpayer, but has been carrying far heavier tax burdens than manufacturers.  We want to make your case that the music industry plays a vital role in the European economic recovery and job creation, because we can create &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/innovation.html#valuation#eia&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;economic impact assessments&lt;/a&gt; on GDP, employment, tax, import and export effects automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because music and culture are often managed at the level of cities, regions and communities, we want to give you all the data on sub-national levels, whether for regions, metropolitan areas or smaller divisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>retroharmonize R package for survey harmonization</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/software/retroharmonize/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/software/retroharmonize/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;retrospective-data-harmonization&#34;&gt;Retrospective data harmonization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of &lt;code&gt;retroharmonize&lt;/code&gt; is to provide tools for reproducible
retrospective (ex-post) harmonization of datasets that contain variables
measuring the same concepts but coded in different ways. Ex-post data
harmonization enables better use of existing data and creates new
research opportunities. For example, harmonizing data from different
countries enables cross-national comparisons, while merging data from
different time points makes it possible to track changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retrospective data harmonization is associated with challenges including
conceptual issues with establishing equivalence and comparability,
practical complications of having to standardize the naming and coding
of variables, technical difficulties with merging data stored in
different formats, and the need to document a large number of data
transformations. The &lt;code&gt;retroharmonize&lt;/code&gt; package assists with the latter
three components, freeing up the capacity of researchers to focus on the
first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the &lt;code&gt;retroharmonize&lt;/code&gt; package proposes a reproducible
workflow, including a new class for storing data together with the
harmonized and original metadata, as well as functions for importing
data from different formats, harmonizing data and metadata, documenting
the harmonization process, and converting between data types. See
&lt;a href=&#34;https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/reference/retrohamonize.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
for an overview of the functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;code&gt;labelled_spss_survey()&lt;/code&gt; class is an extension of &lt;a href=&#34;https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/labelled_spss.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;haven’s labelled_spss class&lt;/a&gt;. It not
only preserves variable and value labels and the user-defined missing
range, but also gives an identifier, for example, the filename or the
wave number, to the vector. Additionally, it enables the preservation –
as metadata attributes – of the original variable names, labels, and
value codes and labels, from the source data, in addition to the
harmonized variable names, labels, and value codes and labels. This way,
the harmonized data also contain the pre-harmonization record. The
stored original metadata can be used for validation and documentation
purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vignette &lt;a href=&#34;https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/articles/labelled_spss_survey.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Working With The labelled_spss_survey Class&lt;/a&gt;
provides more information about the &lt;code&gt;labelled_spss_survey()&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/articles/harmonize_labels.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Harmonize Value Labels&lt;/a&gt;
we discuss the characteristics of the &lt;code&gt;labelled_spss_survey()&lt;/code&gt; class and
demonstrates the problems that using this class solves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also provide three extensive case studies illustrating how the
&lt;code&gt;retroharmonize&lt;/code&gt; package can be used for ex-post harmonization of data
from cross-national surveys:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Starting-up</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-08-24-start-up/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Aug 2020 10:15:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-08-24-start-up/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The big day has come: the co-founders singed off the documents at the public notary and started the registration of a reproducible research start-up in Leiden.  We got a lot of support from our friends! Your encouragement gives us a lot of energy to accomplish our first milestones, and to get Reprex B.V. going!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reprex means &amp;lsquo;reproducible example&amp;rsquo; in data science.  When you are stuck with a problem, creating a reproducible example allows other computer scientists, statisticians, programmers or data users to solve it. In 80% of the cases, you usually find the solution while creating a generalized example.  In the 20% other cases, you can reach out for help easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming days, we are launching demo versions of our headline products, data observatories. &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;music.dataobservatory.eu&lt;/a&gt; will be a fully automated online service that every day collects, processes, cleans, and publishes scientifically valid data about European music.  Very soon after we will launch two other observatories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creative and cultural sector, NGOs, most research institutions, data journalism teams are usually very small, and they do not have internal IT or data science capacities.  We would like to provide them a transparent, high quality, and fully open source solution to acquire data, process it without errors, document it and make sense of it. We would like to embrace the idea of open collaboration among creative enterprises, scientific researchers, NGOs, data journalists and policymakers with our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our work will comply with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bitss.org/opa/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Open Policy Analysis&lt;/a&gt; standards developed by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bitss.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;https://cega.berkeley.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Center for Effective Global Action&lt;/a&gt; and the four principles of &lt;a href=&#34;http://dataobservatory.eu/reproducible/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;reproducible research&lt;/a&gt;: reviewability, replicability, confirmability and auditability.  We believe that these standards apply in reproducible finance, empirical evidence presentation in courts, or advocating sound policies and producing high-quality journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;help&#34;&gt;Do you want to help our start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to enter into the Validation Lab of one of the best artificial intelligence incubators in early September. Talented team members, letters of intents and assignments from organizations will give a lot of credibility to our start &lt;a href=&#34;http://dataobservatory.eu/team/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Meet our team »&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put as in contact with people who love to write code in R and interested in automating business and social science research and primary data collection such as surveying. &lt;a href=&#34;http://dataobservatory.eu/#featured&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Check out what sort of code we create »&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduce us to people who need data and information to make better informed decision and analysis in music, film, book publishing, photography services or socially responsible finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share contacts of data journalists who would like to develop stories from big survey programs like &lt;a href=&#34;https://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Eurobarometer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.afrobarometer.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Afrobarometer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.latinobarometro.org/lat.jsp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Lationbarometro&lt;/a&gt;, or base their storytelling on data and its visualizations. &lt;a href=&#34;http://retroharmonize.satellitereport.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;See our survey harmonization examples »&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2020 Music Professionals Survey Wave</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-music-professional-survey-wave/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-music-professional-survey-wave/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;CEEMID is conducing its 8th survey programme this among musicians, music professionals, and music managers. This is the largest empirical research program in the world about how people work and earn their living in the music industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are teaming up with some music organizations and research universities to form a Music Observatory, which will support all participant countries musicians with free data for royalty calculation, advocacy at government, tour scheduling and tour planning.  This year we particularly focus on effective COVID19 relief measures, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the results of last years&amp;rsquo; results:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Central European Music Industry Report 2020&lt;/a&gt; - free download in PDF, epub, or browse the html version.
&lt;a href=&#34;post/2020-01-30-ceereport/&#34;&gt;CCS Ecosystems: Evidence-Driven CCI Policy &amp;amp; The Central &amp;amp; Eastern European Music Industry Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what&#34;&gt;What?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are asking music organizations to send out our questionnaires to their members, and we ask musicians to forward our questionnaires to music technicians and managers, too. After the fieldwork is done, we are sending back statistically analysed data, reports to the participating countries, and assist local music organizations to make the best use of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;which-countries-are-covered-this-year&#34;&gt;Which countries are covered this year?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous year we covered emerging Europe Austria, Czechia, Croatia, Hungary, Lithuania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year we are aiming to cover some of our regularly surveyed countries, and a number of new, mainly developed markets. The countries will be announced shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Regionalized Cultural Access and Participation (Books And Libraries) And Science Attitudes Variables</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-04-22-regional-eurobarometer/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My new R package, Eurobarometer, helps the creation of data panels and regionalized statistics from the Pan-European survey’s microdata. This allows the creation of many new statistical indicators for the CEEMID Music Observatory and for many market and policy research tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example dataset (Antal 2020) was created from the microdata of the
Eurobarometer 79.2 survey using the development version of the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/antaldaniel/eurobarometer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;eurobarometer R package&lt;/a&gt;.
The dataset can be downloaded from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3759811&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Zenodo&lt;/a&gt;. It will be used in a forthcoming academic publication about book piracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cultural-access--participation-variables&#34;&gt;Cultural Access &amp;amp; Participation Variables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The read a book variable is a weighted sum of the responses that chose
from &lt;code&gt;QB1 How many times in the last twelve months have you read a book?&lt;/code&gt; any answer apart from “not in the last 12 months.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-source--data-processing&#34;&gt;Data Source &amp;amp; Data Processing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source of the data is the microdata file stored in GESIS for the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/sdesc2.asp?db=e&amp;amp;no=5688&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Eurobarometer 79.2
survey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This data file contains the microdata for the Eurobarometer 79.2 survey (TNS Opinion &amp;amp; Social 2013), which includes a Cultural Access and Participation Survey (see (Haan and Broek 2012; Bína, Vladimir et al.2012)) and a Science &amp;amp; Technology Attitude survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey samples are designed to represent the national population,
with the exceptions of Northern Ireland, the former East- and
West-Germany, and the Turkish community on Cyprus. These samples are
designed to be representative for these populations, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For weighting we used the w1 weights, which allow for
post-stratification based on gender, education level and community size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the Republic of Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Luxembourg and
Malta regionalization is not necessary because the entire countries are equivalent to a single NUTS2 region in terms of size and homogeneity. In these countries the weighting produces representative statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, due to a problem with the original data file, no regional information is available for the Republic of Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Germany, Great Britain and Italy, data can be summarized on the level of NUTS1 territories, and we are imputing these values into the constituent (smaller sub-)regions on NUTS2 levels. In the case of the remaining countries it can be summarized on NUTS2 levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the survey samples are designed to be nationally representative, the regional sub-samples are not necessarily representative, and often they are very small. For post stratification purposes, we created a “dirty weighting”, Using the national w1 post-stratification weights, but centered to an average value of 1 for each region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that this causes problems on more detailed answer options (on the level levels of the questionnaire’s question hierarchy.) Except for the science attitudes and the library quality questions, we used relatively simple questions that are less affected by the small,
potentially biased sample size&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better option would be the creation of new, regional
post-stratification weights. We believe that this would be a very
interesting, but very big research task that would potentially need the cooperation of the survey’s producer, Kantar.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First CEEMID Regional Open Data Release</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-04-16-regional-opendata-release/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Apr 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-04-16-regional-opendata-release/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internet use: participating in social networks (creating user profile, posting messages or other contributions to facebook, twitter, etc.) [percentage of individuals]&lt;/em&gt; shows the development of social media use in the past 10 years in very high detail.  Social media is one of the most important ways to communicate with fans and find audiences for gigs, performances and to share new releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Social media use 2011-2019&#34;
           src=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/media/img/dataanimation/internet_use_social_networks.gif&#34;
           loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chosen dataset is highlighting several new priorities of CEEMID.  This indicator, which is based on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=isoc_r_iuse_i&amp;amp;lang=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Eurostat statistical product&lt;/a&gt;, has a much higher data quality than the Eurostat release, it is easier to use, and goes beyond the detail of national statistics.  It contains data on 411 territories in Europe, including countries, provinces and smaller regions, even some metropolitan areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dataset is available on the European open research data repository, &lt;a href=&#34;https://zenodo.org/record/3754574#.XpimX8gzbIU&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Zenodo&lt;/a&gt;. It will be updated annually. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3754574&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3754574.svg&#34; alt=&#34;DOI&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The processing information is available in the dataset.  First, we have used our open source software to correct the regional boundary changes during the decade (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-02-13-regional_eurostat/&#34;&gt;Programatic Approach To Work With European Regional Data Panels&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When data was missing in the end of the dataset, we used the last observation carry forward, when in the beginning, the next observation carry backwards data.  Gaps in the data were interpolated using linear interpolation. Whenever data was available on a larger (provincial level), we imputed it to the smaller regional units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data contains standard national / regional references according the European NUTS2013 standard for backwards compatibility. Further documentation will be available on our methodology on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://documentation.ceemid.eu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;documentation.ceemid.eu&lt;/a&gt; wiki website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last, the data was put into a table that complies with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;tidy data&lt;/a&gt; principles for easier processing on computers and immediate use in spreadsheet applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comparing Social Distancing in Europe</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-04-15-comparing-social-distancing/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;People around the world are facing newer and newer exponential charts everyday. We’re all hoping for new information about the progress against the coronavirus. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these charts is meaningless. In fact, &lt;a href=&#34;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;coronavirus case counts are meaningless&lt;/a&gt;, unless they are done with very heavy statistical knowledge, and even then they are very messy. Countries have different testing and hospitalization protocols, death certificating standards, and there are less and more trustworthy governments. We do not really know the severity of the local epidemics and the relative success of public health policies.&lt;/p&gt;

---&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, we have some timely information on how people and the economy react to the epidemic, because there are ongoing, frequent, and comparable data sources on various consequences of the epidemic.  A particularly interesting big data source is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blog.google/technology/health/covid-19-community-mobility-reports/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Google’s geolocational reporting&lt;/a&gt; on how people’s time spent in homes, workplaces, parks, shopping areas and recreational areas change. Google gets plenty of realtime data from hundreds of millions of people and compares them by days in the week and local time with the ‘baseline’ scenario before the outbreak of the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the locational data of various smartphones and application data, we know that people spend 10-15% more time at home since January, and 40-50% less in their workplaces.  Similar data is available for other locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/img/post/2020-04-15-covid/work_home_en_small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Stay at home or go to the workplace?&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While people are spending less time in the workplace and more at home in every European country, there are significant differences.  Countries in the top left corner, most notable Sweden, switched less from workplaces to homes.  On the bottom right corner, Spain and Italy, which were most hit by the epidemic, are in the most severe form of lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some outliers, like Romania, where people stay a lot more at home, but not so much less in the workplaces – probably they cannot afford to stay clear of the job, but they are reducing other activities.  Or, in the case of Germany, people spend a lot more time in parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/img/post/2020-04-15-covid/difference_summary_en_small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Differences in space use in Europe&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grouped the countries according to their dynamics.  Looking at Belgium and Luxembourg, we see that they are more locked down than the typical European country, but they are moving up in the first week of April compared to the last week of March. This is very much in line with their improving strain on the health system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is worrying is that there appears to be a significant asynchronicity in the Schengen zone, where people and goods should move around freely.  The peripheric countries, which are less densely populated, often less integrated into the global transport and travel routes, are getting into the local epidemics later, and are acting later.  This is logical from a national point of view, but given that the European economy is very much integrated, it will prolong the pain.  The Netherlands, France and Germany need plenty of seasonal agricultural workers from the Southeast, where the lockdown is just getting really strict.  While some of their regions see improving national epidemic situations, the easing will increase the intensity of the local epidemic if a large number of workers will arrive from countries that are just going into the epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efficient solution, as many public health officials keep saying, would be a synchronized effort to contain the virus.  The different pace and strictness of social distancing measures will mean that the local epidemics will not be in synchronization, and the countries will re-infect each other, this way prolonging the economic and social cost of this devastating pandemic.  While health policy is a national competence in the European Union, in fact, the European economic and social life is so much integrated, not only within the Schengen Zone, but even with future, prospective and candidate members states in the Balkans, that a far more coordinated public health policy would be required.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CEEMID &amp;amp; Consolidated Independent presented and discussed with stakeholders the  &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/publication/ceereport_2020/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Central &amp;amp; Eastern European Music Industry Report 2020&lt;/a&gt; as a case-study on national and comparative evidence-based policymaking in the cultural and creative sector on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://creativeflip.creativehubs.net/2019/12/03/flipping-the-odds/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CCS Ecosystems: FLIPPING THE ODDS Conference&lt;/a&gt; – a two-day high-level stakeholder event jointly organized by Geothe-Institute and the DG Education and Culture of the European Commission with the Creative FLIP project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel&amp;rsquo;s presentation was focused around the question on invisibility of the CCI sector in the economic, education and labour policymaking, and the low level of data use in fact-based cultural policy design, and the following policy design problems. Our CEE Music Industry Report 2020 created with the help and support of Consolidated Independent was used as a use case for the problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post is an edited version of Daniel&amp;rsquo;s presentation and the subsequent panel discussion with the stakeholders and organizers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEE Report builds on the results of the first &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/publication/hungary_music_industry_2014/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/publication/slovak_music_industry_2019/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Slovak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/publication/private_copying_croatia_2019/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Croatian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://czdev.ceemid.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Czech&lt;/a&gt; music industry reports are compared with Armenian, Austrian, Bulgarian, Lithuanian, Serbian and Slovenian data and findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/img/publications/cee_report_2020_frontcover.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Central &amp;amp;amp; Eastern European Music Industry Report 2020&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;invisibility&#34;&gt;Invisibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measurement problems and the ‘invisibility’ of creative and cultural industries is a consequence of the fact that these industries are predominantly comprised of microenterprises and individual, freelancing entrepreneurs.  Even larger entities, such as collective management organizations can be classified as small enterprises.
In the EU, small- and medium enterprises, and especially microenterprises usually have reduced reporting duties to the statistical authorities and tax authorities (which is the most important secondary source of government statistics in anonymized, aggregated form.)  This means that the supply side is not visible for policymakers. The recommendation is to conduct sample-based surveys among these microenterprises, but very few member states do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem is that on the demand side, not all member states create statistics.  ESSNet-Culture created recommendations how to measure cultural access and participation, which is a broader term than cultural consumption, as it includes non-market forms, for example, liturgical music, amateur acting, and so on.  The European Commission sometimes makes excellent, but not detailed &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/usecase/cap/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CAP surveys&lt;/a&gt;, which are the most important sources of Eurostat’s relevant pan-European statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEEMID has been making such surveys, both on the supply side (in music and film) and in the audience side (in music, film, theatre, opera, and artistic activities) in several member states, and has plenty of experience with using the EU-mandated CAP surveys of 2007 and 2013. The CEE report relies on the latter date set in first part of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/audience.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;audience analysis&lt;/a&gt;. Our work was already presented in 2015 as a best use case in &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/publication/creating_better_2015/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Creating better national cultural statistics with Eurobarometer datasets and ESSNet-Culture technical recommendations&lt;/a&gt; at GESIS, which maintains the Eurobarometer archives, on the Eurobarometer Symposium &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gesis.org/fileadmin/upload/events/EB-Symposium/Announcement_EB_Symposium.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Four Decades of Surveying Europe –
Perspectives on Academic Research with the European Commission’s Eurobarometer Surveys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the EU the lowest hanging fruit would be to critically assess the past surveys, including the partial CAP survey made in 2017 for the cultural heritage part of culture, and the national surveys conducted by CEEMID and its partners, and to mandate an annual or biannual CAP survey within the Eurobarometer series, probably as a specially sampled “Special Eurobarometer”.  This would very significantly reduce the costs compared to a country-to-country basis, and probably could be shared by other institutions, for example, with the European Audiovisual Observatory.  This alone would greatly increase the demand / consumption side information on the services of creative and cultural enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the panel discussion Consolidated Independent highlighted the problem of leaving sample-based statistics making to the industry itself, which leads to myopical incentives to create ‘policy-based evidence’ that is cherry picked by industry trade associations to fit their often not very well thought out policy agenda.  In our view, the most important role of a future European Music Observatory would be to set standards to data collection and integration.  The music industry is  one of the most data-rich industries globally, but the publicly available, verified, trustworthy information is scarce both for policy-making and for business planning among microenterprises who have know specialized research know-how. Our already existing, representative &lt;a href=&#34;http://survey2019.ceemid.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;national surveys&lt;/a&gt; should and could be extended to the whole Europe with the quality control and visibility offered by such an Observatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;industry-organization&#34;&gt;Industry organization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very significant challenge with evidence-based policymaking, or, in fact, with any policy making is that the extremely fragmented nature of the industry makes national and EU-level consultations very difficult.  Most of the workforce is neither a classical employer nor employee but works as a freelancer or a micro-entrepreneur. Their views are very rarely represented by trade unions or employee associations or chambers of commerce. Despite all efforts on EU level to make the social dialogue more representative for atypical and flexible work forms, the problems and the views of the creative and cultural sectors are largely unrepresented in policy debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prime example of this problem is the very heavy over-taxation of the music industry that we have shown in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/publication/hungary_music_industry_2014/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/publication/slovak_music_industry_2019/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Slovak&lt;/a&gt; national music industry reports, and in other documents in Croatia.  The problem is not only characteristic for the music industry, but generally all CCIs because they share similar economic properties: no real chance to use tax breaks, high level of labour input and high level of value added.  While policy makers and granting authorities spend much time on trying to improve the financing of this sector, in fact, reducing over-taxation would make a much more imminent impact on the liquidity, profitability and growth opportunities of the sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in the making of economic and tax policies, the fragmented creative and cultural industries hardly can represent their special situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;policy-issues&#34;&gt;Policy issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from taxation issues, which significantly reduce the liquidity, profitability and growth opportunities of these sectors in many EU countries, particularly in the CEE, where corporate taxes are low but value-added taxes are high, there are other important policy problem that reduce the long-term growth capacity of the sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very small enterprise size leads to missing strategic human resources (HR) and research and development (R&amp;amp;D) functions in almost all enterprises – including simple market research activities.  Companies with 1-2 employees do not have specialized management and support functions, and thus they have a very strong handicap in HR and R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good example of this problem is the motion picture and TV industry.  These industries were comprised of medium-sized enterprises in the 1980s with significant in-house education functions. The current structure of these industries, however, resembles music, with almost all enterprises staying below the 5-person threshold.  In our experience, based on development needs assessments in the Hungarian motion picture and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://czdev.ceemid.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Czech music industry&lt;/a&gt;, this creates an acute skills and labor shortage.  Missing skills cannot be well replaced by recruitment, or with strategic HR development via life-long learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly to very reduced opportunities to participate in, and create life-long learning schemes, there are very little chances to engage in market research and R&amp;amp;D.  While the music industry, for example, is one of the most data-driven industries in the world, the microenterprise size does not allow that these enterprises commission market research or hire data scientists. This leads to very asymmetrical relationships with the main distributors of music and media content on platforms that are owned by global data companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;recommendations&#34;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel made a few concrete recommendations in the panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating the European Music Observatory, and the creation of similar industry initiatives, and commissioning collaborative (multi-stakeholder) market research, as CEEMID works in many countries, can only replace the missing market research function in the extremely fragmented industries, such as motion picture production, the music industry, but to a certain degree architecture and design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A low-hanging fruit would be a critical assessment of the previous Pan-European CAP surveys and the comparable national CAP surveys conducted by CEEMID and its partners following the ESSNet Culture recommendations and the inclusion of the CAP surveys in an annual or bi-annual form in the Eurobarometer (Special) series. A Special Eurobarometer may be more suitable because usually a non-proportional weighting of the sample gives the best value for money in these surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critically reviewing the participation of micro-enterprises in the current forms of social dialogue and looking for formal or informal ways to increase participation in policy making can gradually lead to more creative-friendly economic regulation and tax policies.  The Hungarian Music Industry Report 2015 and the Slovak Music Industry Report 2019 contains very interesting case studies for this problem that we briefly summarize in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/publication/ceereport_2020/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CEE Music Industry Report 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critically reviewing the few examples from mainly Nordic member states where collective agreements and other collaborative institutions allow microenterprises and freelancers to participate in life-long learning problems can help designing policies that will gradually reduce the huge skill gap of the CCIs in management know-how, data know-how, or renew their technical skills necessary in the production of their services and content. Our work with the Hungarian National Film Fund and surveys among more than a thousand film makers can give much insight into this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CEEMID &amp;amp; Consolidated Independent presented and discussed with stakeholders the  &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/publication/ceereport_2020/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Central &amp;amp; Eastern European Music Industry Report 2020&lt;/a&gt; as a case-study on national and comparative evidence-based policymaking in the cultural and creative sector on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://creativeflip.creativehubs.net/2019/12/03/flipping-the-odds/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CCS Ecosystems: FLIPPING THE ODDS Conference&lt;/a&gt; – a two-day high-level stakeholder event jointly organized by Geothe-Institute and the DG Education and Culture of the European Commission with the Creative FLIP project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEE Report builds on the results of the first &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/publication/hungary_music_industry_2014/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/publication/slovak_music_industry_2019/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Slovak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/publication/private_copying_croatia_2019/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Croatian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://czdev.ceemid.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Czech&lt;/a&gt; music industry reports are compared with Armenian, Austrian, Bulgarian, Lithuanian, Serbian and Slovenian data and findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research findings were earlier presented and discussed in Vienna, Prague, Budapest and Bratislava with stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the earlier presentations in the &lt;a href=&#34;#posts&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; section of the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;executive-summary&#34;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first Central European Music Industry Report is the result of a co-operation that started among stakeholders in three EU countries five years ago to measure the economic value added of music – the basis of a modern royalty pricing system. This gave birth to CEEMID, originally the Central &amp;amp; Eastern European Music Industry Databases, a data integration programme that now in 2020, covers all of Europe. CEEMID fulfils similar roles to the planned European Music Observatory and supports all pillars of the future pan-European system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comparison of Western and Eastern music audiences reveals key demographic differences that make the unchanged adoption of business practices from mature markets in the region questionable. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/audience.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/a&gt; of this report will show these differences and their consequences on music markets, in terms of visiting and acquisition likelihood, frequency, seasonality and purchasing capacity. This is an example of how CEEMID fulfils the role of Pillar 3 (music, society and citizenship) in the planned European Music Observatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/supply.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/a&gt; contrasts market demand with the supply strategies of musicians. CEEMID has been surveying music professionals, including artists, technicians and managers about their working conditions, market conditions and plans for five years across a growing number of countries. In 2019 we invited 100 national and regional stakeholders to distribute our surveys. In some countries, our surveys already have several years of historic data, making the resulting musician database probably the largest ever source of data about how music is produced and how musicians live. We are constantly looking for partners to roll out this survey to new countries in new languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEE region has comparative advantages in big music events like festivals, and it has become one of the most important hubs for cultural tourism in the world. We explain this phenomenon in Chapter 4 by showing the differences in demand composition, demography and supply of venues in the second chapter. The lack of a modern and dense network of permanent music venues gave rise to magnificent music festivals in the CEE. Open’er, Sziget and Exit are among the biggest and best festivals in the world, closely followed by several smaller festivals in all countries. The share of festivals in the live music market is many times higher than in Western Europe and they provide vital export revenues to the local music economies. However, they play a limited role in finding new audiences for local artists, as they are increasingly programming for Western audiences by providing shows of international hits. They can only very partially fill in the gaps left by the small venue problem that hit the emerging markets harder than the UK or Australia, where policy action had been already taken to reverse the decline of the availability of smaller live music venues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the recording side, our analysis shows that modern digital services are growing at a faster rate than in mature markets. Because of lower repertoire competition, streaming quantities are similar for a typical Austrian, Czech, Hungarian, Polish or Slovak track than in the mature markets. However, revenue growth is limited because of the interplay of several analysed factors. Our analysis of the live and recorded music markets shows that CEEMID fulfils the roles of the Pillar 1 (music economy) of the planned European Music Observatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recorded music sales revenue in the region comes from streaming platforms, just like in the mature markets. Successful sales strategies require a solid knowledge of the global marketplace and the ability to understand and train sales algorithms. Micro-enterprises, such as independent labels, have very limited ability to cope with these functions, given that they do not have market research or R&amp;amp;D functions. CEEMID and Consolidated Independent have started initiating open, national R&amp;amp;D consortia to create the necessary concentration in data assets, analytical capacity and budgets to close this gap. As a first step, CEEMID and Consolidated Independent have created a large, independent music dataset based on hundreds of millions of royalty statement entries to create our market indexes, styled after stock market and bond market indexes. Streaming opportunities are fast changing as roll-out of streaming services is happening at a different rate in various territories; subscription charges and the exchange rate to the producer’s currency vary and repertoire competition emerges in the market. Our volume and revenue indexes in &lt;a href=&#34;http://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/export.html#recexport&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Chapter 5.3&lt;/a&gt; are aimed at creating sales algorithms that optimize sales volumes and expected revenues. We believe that this analysis also reveals that CEEMID partially fulfils the roles of Pillar 2 (music diversity and circulation) and feeds important data into Pillar 4 (innovation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The region has far bigger untapped potential than most music business executives believe. Households in the region spend a significantly lower share of their recreational budget on music than their Western, Southern or Nordic peers. The region has a lot of untapped cultural purchasing power because servicing is particularly challenging in both the live and recorded sides of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This upside potential cannot be tapped without better pricing. Royalty levels are often very low in the region. Due to many combined effects analysed in this short report, the gap between royalties earned in the CEE and Western Europe is several times bigger than the difference in GDP or national average wage. These gaps are partly caused by special interests preventing collective management from charging appropriate tariffs for restaurants, media companies or electronic appliance importers and manufacturers, and partly by unfavourable taxation of cultural products and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEEMID was designed to create economic evidence on royalty pricing, private copying compensation and the creation of economic value added in the industry. In the first Hungarian Music Industry Report of ProArt and in the first Slovak Music Industry Report we have shown that economic and taxation policies of the CEE countries aimed to support car and electronics manufacturing create a distorted, unfavourable economic regime for creative industries. We want to help local stakeholders with economic evidence to correct these discriminatory policies during the overhaul of the EU VAT system. We have been helping various national organizations with economic evidence, presented in the light of latest EU jurisprudence, to improve their pricing activities. Our thousands of indicators were also used in ex ante evaluations of granting schemes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, all EU member states will change their copyright administration legislation because of the national implementations of the 2019/790 Digital Single Market directive. CEEMID provides evidence in several countries about the size and impact mechanism of the value transfer, and generally the widespread use of the copyright exemption for private copying. We believe that the thousands of pan-European music industry indicators that we have aggregated over the five years will play a vital role in these regulatory processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEEMID fulfils its roles with a very thorough exploitation of the EU’s 17-years-old Open Data regime with the re-use of public sector information, and a very careful mapping of the music industry. These maps help us conduct annual surveys among musicians and the audience, and they help us connect (always with pre-approval and with a user mandate) to industry databases. We do not only cover the EU countries, but increasingly (potential) candidate countries and neighbourhood countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our vision, this data collection and integration, i.e. Pillars 1-3 should be available for all music stakeholders, should remain public and publicly funded. The last Pillar of the observatory, innovation, is where private entities should compete. The founders of CEEMID and Consolidated Independent believe that this report demonstrates the business and policy benefits of such a system with the analysis of the Central &amp;amp; Eastern European music markets. We believe that this way CEEMID is in a position to serve most of the planned functions of the envisioned European Music Observatory, and we are looking for ways to make either our thousands of indicators, or our data collection and integration software open source and available for all stakeholders in the EU and its neighbours. CEEMID was born out of necessity to level out the different levels of public research and statistical coverage of the EU member states. In our view, private entities in the future should focus their investments in Pillar 4 of the planned observatory, i.e. competing in innovation with creating new models, algorithms and services based on data that is available throughout the European Union without giving further advantage to the already mature markets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was presenting some highlights from the work we started with in the organization of SoundCzech with 25 music professionals representing more than 20 stakeholders in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/talk/2019_10_09_praha/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;How We Would Like To Work in the Czech Music Industry in 2020&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;ex ante&lt;/em&gt; evaluation workshop in the context of the comparative &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/post/2019-09-27_cee_report/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Central European Music Industry Report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can find the full presentation, including slides not shown in the workshop &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/presentation/nouvelle-prague&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The presentation is a self-contained big file of 20Mb, takes time to load.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work is done in a collaborative manner with the open Research Consortium started by SoundCzech, CEEMID &amp;amp; Consolidated Independent.  We would like to invite any Czech stakeholders, or even individuals to join our efforts.  Because in the music sector, all organization are microenterprise or small enterprise sized, they usually have no significant market research, innovation and strategic HR management capacities. We hope to give them in each country useful tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very interesting part of the discussion in the morning was around transparency and potential conflict between stronger and weaker markets. Thank you for all colleagues who came on a Saturday morning after great showcase concerts the night before, and let&amp;rsquo;s stay in touch!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Private Copying in Croatia</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2019-10-31-croatia_pcr/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2019 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2019-10-31-croatia_pcr/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After much delay, the first measurement of licensed use of music, audiovisual content, home copying and value transfer to media platforms in Croatia for a practical update of the private copying remuneration in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the whole study in English, a Croatian language summary and a press release in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/publication/private_copying_croatia_2019/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Publications&lt;/a&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The models presented are simplified models of the Hungarian and Slovak models, with less detailed data. However, they show clearly that in less developed markets, compensation for unlicensed use remains a key issue. Only a very small fraction of households pay for music and film, and creators, performers, film writers are massively undercompensated in the Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania, Poland or the Baltic states of the EU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My study, Private Copying in Croatia, argues that the cultural and welfare benefits of this private copying regime are enormous and important to create a good quality of life in Croatia for all age groups, but especially for young people, and it must be maintained. Furthermore, it is very advantageous for the tech sector, because their products are mainly used with unlicensed music and film copies, given that only a very small portion of the population pays for downloads, or subscribes to services like Spotify, Deezer or Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even for those who are not interested in royalties, the first 3 chapters offer a very interesting introduction on how people listen to music, how musicians make music and how people copy it in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was a continuation of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/post/2016-04-20_makk15/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;mapping of the Croatian music sector&lt;/a&gt;. I have created more detailed valuation and use studies of private copying and YouTube in Hungary (2015, 2017, 2018, 2019) and currently preparing similar studies in other countries, including Slovakia, as a continuation of the work started with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/publication/slovak_music_industry_2019/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Slovak Music Industry Report&lt;/a&gt; and generally my home copying work started in 2012 with &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/post/cisac_goodg_13/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Value added by music in public performance and home copying: economic theory and empirical applications for tariff setting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Central European Music Industry Report Presentation</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2019-09-27_cee_report/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2019 08:05:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2019-09-27_cee_report/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had the first public and panel discussion of the forthcoming Central European Music Industry Report.  After mapping and analysing in depth the music industries of several CEE countries, I put together with the help of Consolidated Independent and state51 a regional report in previously unseen detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can review the whole &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/presentation/CEE_Music_Report.html&#34;&gt;presentation here&lt;/a&gt; (10Mb self-contained HTML file, takes some time to load).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&#34;post/2016-04-20_makk15&#34;&gt;mapping&lt;/a&gt; and analysing (see most recently &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/publication/slovak_music_industry_2019/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt;) in depth the music industries of several CEE countries, with the help of Consolidated Independent I put together a regional report in previously unseen detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The live music part explains the different demography and other demand drivers of the CEE region for concerts, resulting in high seasonality, low venue profitability, an unusually high vulnerability of small venues – and as a result an unusually strong music festival scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For recordings, the report shows the royalty gap in comparison to Western Europe and the difficulties of labels and publishers to create value added to musicians.  In the absence of a fully functional recording market, musicians are more reliant on collective management revenues than in the rest of Europe – yet in many countries collective management has profound difficulty in asking the correct price for music or collecting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/img/ceemid/expenditure_private_cultural_cinema_theatre_concert_filled_plot.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Consumer demand for music events&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When analysing the music flows among European countries, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/post/cross_border_2019/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;export-import flows&lt;/a&gt; of other emerging markets in Latin America and the worlds most stable ones, like that of the United States, Brazil and Japan, we must realize that these nations face an uphill battle to get into the better paying markets and at the same time to protect their domestic market from increasing import substitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music grants could be an important tool to balance the disadvantaged position of CEE musicians in this global competition.  Austria and Hungary has a strong popular music support program, but usually the availability and suitability of grants is lower in those countries where musicians and their technical and managerial team would need it most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very grateful for the support given by &lt;a href=&#34;https://ci-info.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Consolidated Independent&lt;/a&gt; in the making of this report. CI is the market leader in managed services for the digital music industry, connecting the best independent music with the opportunities of the global market. With their data science team, we put together data from about 700,000,000 royalty statement documents about the whole region. I believe that this is the first time that a global player releases large amounts of data to help understanding the changing music landscape in the era of digital streaming. Equally thankful for Franz Hergovich (Music Austria) for inviting us to discuss these findings on &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/talk/waves_2019/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Waves Music Showcase Festival and Conference&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;on 27 September 2019&lt;/em&gt;  with Márton Náray (SoundCzech) and Péter Benjámin Tóth (Artisjus). And of course, the most important people to thank for are the more than 2000 musicians, managers and technicians who participated in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/post/2019-06-07_ceemid_survey/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CEEMID Music Professional Survey&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of the main data sources of this report, where no other information was available. You can find out more about the data sources &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/usecase/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The report will be shortly released in a free downloadable ebook, and musicians, who requested it, will receive their personalized mini-reports shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All feedback is, as always, welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Music Exports &amp; Imports</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Europe, like most regions of the world, is a net importer of music, but has very signficant export potential. Intra-European export is also very significant, especially from Germany, France, Sweden and the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Central and Eastern European region is relatively weak in exporting recorded and live performances, but it is among global leaders in creating export revenues from festivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently I am involved in creating predicitve models that help finding the best potential foreign market for music, and I make economic impact assessments of cultural tourism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Streaming Market Growth on European Markets</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2019-09-24_streaming-market/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2019 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2019-09-24_streaming-market/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have never been a great fan of the headline figures reported by the recording industry about streaming growth.  I always felt that however dynamic are those charts, artists keep complaining that they do not feel these developments.  So I started to decompose those growth figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Global Music Report quotes national streaming revenues on a dollar basis, which contains a lot of currency exchange noise.  And behind the national total there are too many factors: subscriber base growth and repertoire growth and the subscription fee.  The interplay of these forces is unpredictable. Whenever a local artist or producers sees a 10% reported national growth, they can never be sure if this will likely cause their sale to grow or shrink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the changes in the subscriber base and the available competing repertoire, it is important to see if the artist’s segment is growing, and if the competition is growing. The sales platforms will never reveal such data, and anyway, there is a competition among many sales platforms.
I was looking for an analogy for a similar problem. Securities are a bit similar to songs, they will produce later cash flows, and they are competing for an always changing number of investors and with a constantly changing competition in the investible universe.  Songs and their royalty flows exhibit similarities with both equity and bonds, and I believe that a good solution is the creation of song indexes, similarly to stock and bond indexes that represent the performance of various security classes.
After many hours of work with the state51 data science team, and at least as much processing work for the servers, we came up with a dataset that contained data from about 700 million royalty statements. I designed a sampling method that is far from perfect, but I think it gives a first birds-eye view on the European markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/img/dataanimation/animated_median_quantity_plot.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Growth of the &amp;amp;rsquo;typical&amp;amp;rsquo; songs streams on various markets&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every country and every month, we selected those exploited songs that were in the middle of the exploitation range: as many songs were less listened to as many were more listened too.  For simplicity, I call those selected songs the ‘typical songs’ for each streaming platform and royalty territory.  I added together the streaming quantities on the three major platforms. For every territory and month, this could have been the sales of a ‘typical’ song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like stock and bond indexes, we can create even more relevant indexes for certain rightsholders.  In the Central European Music Industry Report, we will present for each territory a ‘domestic’ and a ‘foreign’ index, because the sales potential of a Slovak song in Slovakia or in Austria is very different from a British song in Slovakia or Austria.  In Slovakia, a Slovak song is on a home territory and in Austria in a near territory, while the British song is on one of the almost 200 territories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These findings will be open to discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/talk/waves_2019/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Waves Music Showcase Festival and Conference&lt;/a&gt; [click for details] &lt;em&gt;on 27 September 2019.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>National Market Shares on Spotify Hitlists</title>

---&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take a look at the streaming charts of the region, we usually find that the vast majority of the streamed songs are foreign songs - except for Austria, U.S. songs.  For comparison, we added a similar, middle-income emerging market (Argentina) and a rich, small-population English-speaking country, Australia to the chart. These countries seem to be in a similar position to the CEE countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/img/dataanimation/domestic_market_share_animation.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Market shares August-September 2019&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguably, the strongest countries of songwriting are the United States and Brazil - these are the countries that have ran out of the ISRC recording identifier range. Their charts are full with their domestic songs, but they are not alone.  Japan, France, and the bigger EU countries, France, Germany and Poland have very strong domestic performance, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are many factor at play here. Large countries with large artist populations generate a lot more recordings, so they local fans always have thousands of new songs to select from.  In small countries, the total annual creations, from pop to jazz, from authentic folk to classical amounts to a few thousand tracks. But it is not only size that matters.  Sweden&amp;rsquo;s population is similar to that of Austria, Hungary and Czechia, yet the Swedish repertoire performs better in Sweden, and as we will see in the next chart, abroad, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created a second data animation to visualize how hits were travelling across the borders in the summer of 2ö19. To make the chart easier to read, we omitted the United States, Brazil and Japan as countries of origin, and concentrated only on intra-European hit flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/img/dataanimation/cross_border_plot-animation.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Cross-border hits August-September 2019&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second week of September 2019 was not an exceptional week. Most EU countries&amp;rsquo; producers did not score any hits in any other EU countries&amp;rsquo; Spotify Top 50 hits.  The UK exported many great hits to all over Europe, as usual, but there were other important hit flows. These hits mainly follow cultural proximity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France exported hits to the two Francophone countries of Europe, Belgium and Romania, and furthermore to Greece, a Southern country with particularly unique chart composition. Germany exported many hits to Austria, another German-speaking country, and some hits to other Germanic countries. Dutch producers placed a few hits in the Germanic countries and in Belgium, where the Dutch-speaking Flemish community has its own radios, TVs, press and hitlists. The Netherlands is a powerhouse of electronic popmusic that are not bound by language which finds audience in several countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strength and competitive position of the national market where an artists is most known and has a fan base is usually a determining factor of track performance and revenue.  The overall revenue prospects and competition situation of a Hungarian or Croatian song is very different from a British or even a Polish song.  But overall, most European recordings are not bound to a domestic country. Because of cultural proximity, the presence of native minorities or new immigrant diasporas, even small-language songs are being listened to on a much wider territory than the artists&amp;rsquo; original country. Some relatively small EU countries, such as Sweden and the Netherlands successfully export their music on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, as the streaming services slowly overtake all other forms of use, the charts above depict a very fundamental market change.  Whereas in the traditional channels of physical sales, digital downloads and broadcasting, the CEE countries, like other small- and medium-sized EU countries, enjoyed 30-50% market share, among the streaming hits their producer&amp;rsquo;s share is below 10%. It is not unusual to find only domestic recordings in physical sales hitlists, while domestic songs rarely enter the streaming charts in the region, with the exception of Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional sales channels protected CEE markets in several ways.  After EU accession most import duties are gone, but physical products have very significant logistics costs, which gives local producers a competitive edge.  Because physical products are increasingly sold on concerts and festivals, where the market share of domestic performers is usually very high, the traditional, mechanically licensed sales had a protected market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broadcasting channel, which used the be the most important promotion channel, too, was protected in many European countries by national content quotas, or supported with generously funded national, regional, local public broadcasters who gave a preference to national composers, producers and performers. These market barriers are not present in the streaming markets, which poses many questions. Our research is aiming to answer these questions, but it took several years to build a data infrastructure that can help producing an accurate market overview.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Musicians’ Living Standards And Life Satisfaction In The CEE Region</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In order to get a high-level comparison among the living standards of musicians, we use the standard survey question used in Eurobarometer surveys for decades: how often have had the respondent difficulties with paying bills in the past year?   This is a very good starting point because it makes comparable the rough material standards of musicians and other professional groups in the EU, irrespective of local earnings and living costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musicians everywhere, including rich countries like Germany, Austria and Slovenia have more problems with paying their bills than the general population in their countries.  The only seemingly different country is Bulgaria, but in this case, the self-reported difference is small, and generally Bulgarian musicians and other Bulgarian people have similarly frequent difficulties with paying their bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in an emerging economy is more stressful than in a mature economy – making ends is more difficult, risks are greater and usually rules change faster. No wonder that people generally report higher level of life satisfaction in countries where the living standards are also higher: average life satisfaction in a country is &lt;a href=&#34;https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;greatly influenced&lt;/a&gt; by national income and general health level, measured by life expectancy.  However, it is also recorded since the 1970s that after reaching a certain level of living standards, life satisfaction does not increase further with economic conditions. Other factors, such as vocation, work-life balance and political factors play a role, too. Working in an emerging economy is more stressful than in a mature economy – making ends is more difficult, risks are greater and usually rules change faster.&lt;/p&gt;

      Comparing the life satisfaction levels of musicians with the general public, 2018-2019.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the emerging music business countries, it is very important to see that the musicians not only earn little money, but as freelancers their income is mainly based on live performances, peaking in the festival season and in December. This income is usually taxed at far higher rates in the CEE region than in Western Europe or in non-creative industries.  Royalties, which should balance variable live performance earnings are far lower both as a percentage of total musician income and in euro terms than in advanced markets. This is often coupled with higher taxation, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid the bias of higher satisfaction levels in richer environments, we measure musician’s self-reported life satisfaction levels against the national averages from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/sdesc2.asp?no=7489&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;2018/11 Eurobarometer sample&lt;/a&gt;, scaled between the numerical values of -2 (not at all satisfied) to 2 (very satisfied).&lt;/p&gt;
















&lt;figure  id=&#34;figure-comparing-the-life-satisfaction-levels-of-musicians-with-the-general-public-2018-2019&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Comparing the life satisfaction levels of musicians with the general public, 2018-2019.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our comparison shows that in most of our surveyed countries, musicians are more satisfied with their lives than the average person, despite having more material difficulties.  Of course, age, and other factors can contribute to this, but a vocational calling is certainly an important aspect, too.  The exceptions are, interestingly, Austria and Slovenia, where the general population has a very high level of life satisfaction, and where both musicians and the general public are generally more satisfied with their lives than in the other countries. In these cases, compared to the general population, music professional are less satisfied with their lives. In Serbia our sample is too small to draw real conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Comparing the difficulties of paying bills among musicians and the general public, 2018-2019.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Career in music can lead to higher life satisfaction than other similarly paid jobs in Europe.  However, music market stakeholders should focus on increasing the level of music professional earnings and reducing its variance within the year and over the years, because the material living conditions of musicians is significantly worse than the conditions of the general population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our recent private copying reports we compiled European survey data relevant to analysis.  In Europe, there is a big difference between the use of electronic entertainment devices in richer and poorer countries. Nevertheless, the real difference is between the number of people who sometimes and who never pay for downloaded music, films and software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some countries of Europe, less then 10 percent of the population ever pays for the content that is loaded to their computers, smartphones and tablets.  These survey data, accompanied by other objective data, can help explaining 96% of the variance among digital music sales levels within the EU countries, and it is highly relevant in calculating the economic benefit of home copying for users, and the harm for rightsholders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CEE Mini Recording Industry Workshop</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2017-11-01_cee_mini/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I presented my market view and experience with distinguished colleagues from the Baltic states, Central Europe and the Balkan, representatives of WIN and IFPI and the international indie distributor State 51. We had a lively discussion on why emerging markets are emerging so slowly in the new digital music business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a decade of decline due to piracy and change in business model, the global music business is steadily growing.  However, defying some economic expectation, to growth is stronger in mature markets than in most emerging markets, and most of the global growth came from the United States. The dollar-based IFPI Global Music Report hides the fact that mature and emerging Europe is truly lagging behind the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European music scene is very fragmented, has many languages and the lack of critical market size often leads to neglect by innovative global players. In a world where most music is soled by big data driven algorithms in subscription streams, the lack of large repertoires, data analytics capabilities and critical audience masses puts the smaller European repertoires into a competitive disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a very interesting discussion that will lead to hopefully many new initiatives on a number of problems, including low market prices in collectively managed and private channels, distribution problems, the difficulties and opportunities in regional cooperation and a number of other topics.
The presentation and the working paper is not public, but the similar workshops in the future may help growing a more mature network of CEE industry players and the adoption of new business models, pricing and promotion methods and more coordinated planning and marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CEEMP Session: Licensing, How To Tackle The Value Gap And A Discussion on Licensing Initiatives</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2017-09-29_ceempc/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CEEMID had the honor to participate in the third panel of CEEMP in Warsaw together with Ben McEwen from ICE; Jules Parker from Spotify and Dominic Houston from Netflix, and Chris Butler from Music Sales, who is also the chairperson of ICMP. Our panel was moderated by Nigel Elderton from peermusic, who is also the new chairperson of PRS in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jules from Spotify spoke about their new initiative, Spotify for Publishers.  Spotify pays out about 20% of its royalties to publishers.  Because the labels are the bigger stakeholders, they often do not provide the necessary information for work identification in the case of publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominic from Netflix is already one of the biggest buyers of music, and I believe that his company’s footprint will just continue growing.  His time buys licenses only 10% of their music from publishers. They mainly use original film music, and to a significant degree, catalogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben made a presentation about their innovation efforts at ICE digital rights management. Working with some of the largest repertoires represented by PRS, GEMA and STIM, they really offer world class services. Next year they promise to scale services to smaller repertoires, who can immediately benefit from low-cost identification from the cleaned data of these large societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital gap between household cultural spending and CE / S European music industry revenues in the digital world
Comparing household cultural spending with digital music revenues in Europe’s main regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel’s short presentation highlighted the fact that the CEE region’s is much richer in terms of household cultural and recreational spending that it is thought by the music industry, because the music industry is really lagging its Western and Nordic peers in tapping into this pool of money.  There are many reasons for this, all a bit touched upon the other speaker’s issues, and their implementation difficulties n the CEE region, especially different revenue stream breakup, strong collective management and relatively underdeveloped publishing.  The region is about 200% or more below its benchmark in the sales we were talking about in this session.  The conversation will continue in Brussels, Prague, Budapest, Bratislava and Warsaw in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Changing Musician Career Paths</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2017-02-03-music_career_path/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2017 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2017-02-03-music_career_path/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the 20th century the first career step was to get on stage and create a credible live performance. After several years on the stage musician’s got a recording contract, and usually even later they registered their first composition. The recording stream was the most important revenue source. The making of a record was expensive and offered considerable royalties or advances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 21st century the live music stream is far more important than the recordings. Creating recordings is much cheaper and stage performances are expensive. Musicians usually create their music, also register it as a music work and offer it to the public on an online portfolio of mp3 downloads, YouTube and music streams.  Often they are booked for their first live performance after publishing a recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean for the musician and the manager?  First and foremost that traditional career development strategies do not work anymore. A convincing stage performance is mandatory with a good touring strategy.  Recordings are often not profitable, but equally important in building the audience. Making the recording stream a revenue stream instead of the cost stream requires a very good understanding of the costs and benefits of the different digital channels. CEEMID also contains market information on these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Career information in CEEMID&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milestones of the musician’s career&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level of professionalization, secondary career paths&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Income level and basic live standards information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production and concert volumes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue breakup in all the three major income streams, i.e. publishing, recording and live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data is available for Croatia, Hungary and Slovakia. Breakup by genre, gender, birth year, age cohort, capital  / countryside is also possible.  Similar surveys are being conducted in the film production industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with sub-national statistics has many benefits. In policymaking or in social sciences, it is a common practice to compare national statistics, which can be hugely misleading. The United States of America, the Federal Republic of Germany, Slovakia and Luxembourg are all countries, but they differ vastly in size and social homogeneity. Comparing Slovakia and Luxembourg to the federal states or even regions within Germany, or the states of Germany and the United States can provide more adequate insights. Statistically, the similarity of the aggregation level and high number of observations can allow more precise control of model parameters and errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantages of switching from a national level of the analysis to a
sub-national level comes with a huge price in data processing,
validation and imputation. The package Regions aims to help this
process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This package is an offspring of the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://ropengov.github.io/eurostat/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;eurostat&lt;/a&gt; package on
&lt;a href=&#34;http://ropengov.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;rOpenGov&lt;/a&gt;. It started as a tool to validate and re-code regional Eurostat statistics, but it aims to be a general solution for all sub-national statistics. It will be developed parallel with other rOpenGov packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sub-national-statistics-have-many-challenges&#34;&gt;Sub-national Statistics Have Many Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequent boundary changes&lt;/strong&gt;: as opposed to national boundaries,
the territorial units, typologies are often change, and this makes
the validation and recoding of observation necessary across time.
For example, in the European Union, sub-national typologies change
about every three years and you have to make sure that you compare
the right French region in time, or, if you can make the time-wise
comparison at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hierarchical aggregation and special imputation&lt;/strong&gt;: missingness is
very frequent in sub-national statistics, because they are created
with a serious time-lag compared to national ones, and because they
are often not back-casted after boundary changes. You cannot use
standard imputation algorithms because the observations are not
similarly aggregated or averaged. Often, the information is
seemingly missing, and it is present with an obsolete typology code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Mapping the Croatian Music Industry</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2016-04-20_makk15/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2016-04-20_makk15/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Daniel Antal presented the preliminary findings of the Croatian music industry research in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.makk.hr/web/en/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;International Authors’ and Creators’ Conference (Međunarodna autorska kreativna konferencija, #MAKK2015)&lt;/a&gt; in Zagreb on 24 November 2015. The presentation was largely based on analysis of various CEEMID databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Central European music industry, as shown by processing the data of more than 2000 musicians in the region is even more reliant on live performances than the British music industry.  Even though Croatia appears to be more similar to the UK than the region, a deeper analysis of the data reveals that this is not the case. The most important difference between mature markets and emerging markets is the lack of good distribution and monetization strategy for recorded music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collecting and analyzing industry data is very important for small, national music industries that do not have a large enough repertoire that can be easily promoted on global platforms such as Spotify, Deezer or YouTube.  New digital platforms produce relatively low income for Central and Southeastern European artists and labels, but they are growing at a rate similar to mature markets with a short, 1-5 years lag. Understanding the different strategies of global service providers, forthcoming liberalization and data-driven analytics are very important to maintain the share of domestic music in the radio and television channels and further expand it in the new channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More insights will be published on our blog and the forthcoming Regional music industry report. To be involved in the data collection and sharing of the Croatian national industry report please contact HDS-ZAMP, ZAPRAF, HGU or Unison in Croatian or CEEMID in English.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Granting And Policy Evaluation For Musicians In Hungary</title>
      <link>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2015-11-12-cstp/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2015 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2015-11-12-cstp/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The data and intelligence of CEEMID was used in Hungary to create an ex ante evaluation of the new &lt;code&gt;Cseh Tamás Program&lt;/code&gt; to support popular music development in Hungary.  Our mandate was to create concrete granting proposals that have a high chance of making a change in terms of the later royalty earning capabilities of artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/project/ceemid/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CEEMID&lt;/a&gt; is now part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Digital Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first phase of the project, we made two workshops with the eight fields development method to understand the challenges and existing working practices that result in a low level of royalties paid out in Hungary. This methodology requires a groupwork of all stakeholders and professionals of the industry. In this case, we worked in groups of 30-40, covering various artists, stage, light, sound technicians, producers, managers and even band transporters.  One group predominantly was Budapest-based and one in Eastern Hungary, to have a different view on working and market conditions in the metropolitan city and in the countryside. While royalties are not applicable for live music, it was well understood by the granting authority and the music industry that royalties cannot grow without a healthy live music sector in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the workshop, the consultant with several aides facilitates a very structured conversation that starts with a desired state of the industry which is not described by slogans but by actual characterizations of a desired working environment.   Instead of envisioning that “everybody gets a grant”, we describe the ideal project planning and management cycle of a new tour or record to see how a granting can fit into this workflow and what type of grants add effective assistance to realize goals.  For each goal and change we envision how that effects the work of the performing artists, her manager, the technician crew, even the schedule of the tour bus driver.  We discuss if the change makes any material change in the way we can prepare for a new album release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latter stages what sort of changes we envision in day practices, programmers, institutions and what concrete steps are needed to be made to get there.  As a controlling step, we assign indicators that can be objectively judged, and which can show the degree of change if recommended actions are taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage of the eight-fields methodology, which was originally developed to support EU and global aid program design is that it allows conflicting viewpoints, finding consensus, and display very highly detailed policy and program scenarios already in a day. It is generally a very enjoyable experience for artists and professionals.  If the workshop takes place over 2 days, a first draft program is already presented on the second morning and by the end of the day participants usually have a detailed program.  In this case, we came up with dozens of concrete proposals, many of which could be addressed to the stakeholders themselves without any action taken from the granting authority.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next stage we carried out the annual CEEMID Music Professional Survey with additional questions where artists, managers and technicians could rate the proposals.  They could also optionally give their next year development priorities in the fields of live performances, recordings and composition, in the context of their current work, pre-existing financing and professional assistance of financial assistance needs.  In Hungary, more than 1000 music professionals filled out the survey in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the workshop and the survey, we could present a very comprehensive policy and granting program, with preliminary estimates on granting needs, ideal and minimum grant sizes, and grant contractual conditions to avoid grant calls that cannot be contracted out to winners due to unrealistic prerequisites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results, with suggested cultural policy indicators, program indicators and budgetary outlines were presented to the granting authority of the Cseh Tamás Program (currently named: &lt;a href=&#34;https://hangfoglalo.hu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hangfoglaló Popular Music Support Program&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can review the slides below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/MPGDNcEefEU04I&#34; width=&#34;595&#34; height=&#34;485&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; style=&#34;border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom:5px&#34;&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;//www.slideshare.net/antaldaniel/sgeur13-1037-dantal&#34; title=&#34;Value added by music in public performance and home copying: economic theory and empirical applications in tariff setting&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Value added by music in public performance and home copying: economic theory and empirical applications in tariff setting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//www.slideshare.net/antaldaniel&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dániel Antal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contents&lt;/strong&gt;:
2. Private copying: blank carriers, technology-driven challenges&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technological changes coupled with arbitrage opportunities on the Single Market undermine revenue collection in some jurisdictions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmarking breaks down if race starts to the bottom. You can adjust your tariffs to the neighbor without in-depth analysis as long your neighbor charges the right amount. ght) owners. Instead of simple benchmarking of fees, basic market variables such as quantities (number of tracks copied in homes), price variables, artist incomes should be compared in an economically meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimating quantities, methodology, survey design Consumer surplus estimate requires reliable quantity estimates that can be best collected on an international basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private copying: various challenges make economic assessment unavoidable. Value of intellectual property changes: technological and cultural changes modify the use of private copies. Economics deals with subjective value that is not indifferent of use. Compensation estimates must be updated when you blank carriers or copying technology enters the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVM, choice modeling and hedonic pricing results Well designed economic estimates not only justify tariffs, but can create better value proposition for royalty payers. CVM surveys result in well-behaved demand curves for music in public places. Tariffs can be directly validated. Choice modeling reveals that consumers demand music and are rather insensitive to its price. Tariff levels are generally approved. Hedonic pricing reveals the different value added by different restaurants, bars, etc. – crucial for good value proposition and risk sharing with differentiated tariffs. Source: Various surveys designed by Visegrad Investments, conducted by Gfk Hungary, Universitas and Artisjus territorial representatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Econometric analysis differentiates high- and low-willing-to-pay customers Improving existing tariff differentiation can lead to a win-win situation. The same amount of royalty can be collected with less pain and less risk of loosing royalty payers, or even increase the number of customers who can experience high-quality 9 Economic analysis helps to create better tariff differentiation that is more accepted by payers without changing the average level of royalties, leading to less loss to royalty-free or cheap repertoire alternatives. Willingness-to-pay survey based on new hypothetical offerings reveal that better differentiated tariffs can significantly improve value proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public performance: changes in the restaurant, entertainment, retail outlet industry makes periodical tariff review necessary. The structure of restaurant, leisure and retailing changed significantly over two decades, creating chains of restaurants or retail outlets that have significant bargaining power and professional purchasing management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
