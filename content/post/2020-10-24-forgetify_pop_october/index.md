When you work on recommendation engines, particularly recommendation engines that are different from the ones developed by large media or streaming platforms, you do not want to consider goals and directions that you follow, but also the road where you do not want to end up at all. For me, Forgetify has always been a puzzling and wonderful application, because it shows purely where your artists do not want to end up.

[Forgetify](https://forgotify.com/) is a wonderful application that is “recommending” you songs that have never been played on Spotify.  Music from artists that has not been played by their fans, their friends or foes, brothers and sisters, children and grandchildren! I use recommendations in quotation marks, because their recommendations are usually based on your taste. Forgetify just picks you a song that has not been played on Spotify ever. (Never been played means that somebody may have started it, but very soon stopped playing the song.)

What connects me to Forgetify particularly is their motto: “We love music.” 

As you can learn from their website, there are millions of Spotify songs that have been played only partially or never at all. And that is exactly the opposite that our partners want to achieve when they work with us.

I started to create several playlists with Forgetify.  All I did is that I took their “recommendation” and put it on a list, then hit next.  I skipped tracks that were not licensed to the Netherlands, or which were not music tracks but spoken words, like comedies. Then I put these tracks on three lists -- something that I felt was appropriate called “classical music“, another that is “popular music“, and another which is a mix of historical recordings, world music and other music which I think has such a special audience that it would not make a good mix with the other two. Just the labels `popular music` or `classical music` call for further explanation, but we'll get there another time.

Of course, like using the word “recommendations”, the expression of “popular music” is a bit ironic here, because we are talking about music which is anything but popular, at least on Spotify.


Below the music player you find a very short [comparison](#comparison) of the current global hits, [a subjective list](https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-18-october_playlist/) that I created for this month and started to use for explaining our recommendations, my *Forgetify Pop October 2020* list.  I will follow these songs in the coming years, and will keep adding new forgotten songs to my list.


## A Quick Comparison {#comparison}


The next comparison uses some musicology and sound engineering
“features” of the songs on the three lists. These characteristics
are themselves recognized by algorithms, and they are used for Spotify’s own recommendations.

If anything is clear from these boxplots is that there is nothing clear about forgotten songs. The boxplot's box show the typical values of popularity or other features, and the line starting from the box still relatively frequent values.  The long boxes of the Forgetify Pop list show that there are all sorts of music on Forgetify: screechy and not, danceable and not, cheerful and sad. My subjective list is shorter and more pronounced: it contains songs that I found to be a good match to listen together.  The current global hits are less similar than my personal selection, but far more homogeneous than all those millions of songs that end up in the forgotten long tail of the catalogue.

Of course, the only thing that connects this playlist is that the songs are not classical or world/folk music, and that they are forgotten. The [This Time](https://open.spotify.com/track/62y0aOSPRK1rL7lo780cgH) single from 2009 by the Intonated (3 listeners this month, including myself) is heavy guitar music. It is dark. [Perdido](https://open.spotify.com/album/6cCHMZdMkfhpebJ0s6rRNR) from the *Candido Featuring Al Cohn* album released in 1956 by the 
Candido Camero (6945 monthly listeners) is a cheerful jazz song. It is likely that this song actually has an audience, but not on Spotify.

My personal favorite from the Forgetify Pop list is [Groovy & Linda](https://open.spotify.com/track/21nQDfg5BMxp7vGARpOBmo) frTomom the *Neon Princess* album released in 1968 by Tom Parrott (39 monthly listeners). It is a nice hippy song with the favorite effect of '68, the inclusion of a sitar.  The song is not very good, the sitar and the guitar make a rather chaotic mix, but Tom Parrott (born in 1944, Washington DC, United States) is not forgotten because he was bad.

## So why are songs forgotten?
