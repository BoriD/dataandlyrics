When you work on recommendation engines, particularly recommendation engines that are different from the ones developed by large media or streaming platforms, you do not want to consider goals and directions that you follow, but also the road where you do not want to end up at all. For me, Forgetify has always been a puzzling and wonderful application, because it shows purely where your artists do not want to end up.

[Forgetify](https://forgotify.com/) is a wonderful application that is “recommending” you songs that have never been played on Spotify.  Music from artists that has not been played by their fans, their friends or foes, brothers and sisters, children and grandchildren! I use recommendations in quotation marks, because their recommendations are usually based on your taste. Forgetify just picks you a song that has not been played on Spotify ever. (Never been played means that somebody may have started it, but very soon stopped playing the song.)

Below the music player you find a very short [comparison](#comparison) of the current global hits and the current hits in the Netherlands on Spotify. This time I would like to illustrate the difference of my listening habits from the global mainstream, and I won't go in depth to how we want to make more relevant recommendations. These are the difference that we are trying to capture for local music scenes, cities, countries in our [Listen Local](https://dataandlyrics.com/project/listen_local/) initiative.

*If you find it interesting why I chose these songs in October 2020, you read about [my choices](https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-18-october_playlist#october-playlist) as a personal recommendation at the end of the post*.

## A Quick Comparison {#comparison}

My playlist is a very subjective and curated playlist... (*I curated it myself, after all\!*) These songs are very different from the songs that people are more likely listening to around me in the Netherlands, or all over the world. 



The next comparison uses some musicology and sound engineering
“features” of the songs on the three lists. These characteristics
are themselves recognized by algorithms, and they are used for Spotify’s own recommendations.

<img src="october_playlist_comparison_forgetify.png" width="90%" /> My songs
are independent songs, far less popular than the global hits. My
playlist is mainly indie rock, so far less danceable, less loud than the current hits, but it is more energetic\! The average tempo is similar to the hits, but I tend to chose slower songs, too.

Spotify’s `valence` is a quantitative measure that aims to capture the
positiveness conveyed by the a sound recording(e.g.happy, cheerful,
euphoric on the positive side, and sad, depressed, angry on the negative side). Another striking difference among my list and the two hitlists is the far broader scale of emotions conveyed by the songs that I selected for October 2020.
