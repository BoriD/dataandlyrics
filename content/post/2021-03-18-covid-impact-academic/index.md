After a couple of months on planing, the IASPM event I organised on the impacts of Covid-19 on the European Music Industries took place yesterday. The event featured six speakers, from Wales, England, Germany, Norway and the Netherlands. This work builds on the previous work I have posted concerning the situation in Wales – which you can access [here](https://paulcarr.org/2020/11/21/live-music-in-wales-a-report-for-the-culture-welsh-language-and-communications-commitee/) and [here](https://paulcarr.org/2020/12/03/paul-carr-presentation-to-culture-welsh-language-and-communications-committee-the-live-music-industry-in-wales-post-pandemic/).

There was some fascinating discussion that took place both during and after the presentations, which you can now see via the recording below. For me, I think the one noticeable factor was how much all of our nations had in common. Despite different rules regarding the opening up of our respective venues, we all shared common concerns surrounding factors such as how best to support our live music industries post covid, how to identify gaps in our live music ecologies due to stakeholders leaving the profession, how to train those who wish to enter the profession and how to work with governments to ensure the necessary research takes place and communication infrastructures are in place. It will be interesting to monitor these various projects over the coming months to ascertain how much impact they have, but in the meantime enjoy the recording. Thanks to all of the speaks and the International Association for the Study of Popular Music for hosting.
