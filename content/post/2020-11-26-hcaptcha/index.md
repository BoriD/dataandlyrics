If you tried to fill out forms, find product information, you are have filled out many riddles, captchas.  These captchas are there to prevent robots filling out the forms with funny data, steal your email address or to pretend to be human viewers for paid traffic, because who wants to pay for bots visiting the website?

The problem with the captcha business is that until now, Google was the main provider of them. Website publishers can include their service free of charge into your system, however, the solution is riddled with conflicts of interest. Maybe because Google is the worlds biggest advertising agency, it sometimes allows through bots.  And maybe because Google is selling personalized ads, when you fill out such a captcha, Google records tons of data about you. And, as you can guess, robots have become very good in solving their captchas, too.

>“Competing with Google and other Big Tech companies seems like a tall order: their monopolistic market power, platform effects and army of highly paid developers are generally considered too powerful to tackle for anyone but other tech giants such as Facebook or Amazon. Our story shows that it doesn't have to be that way - you can beat Big Tech by focussing on privacy.”

Eli-Shaoul Khedouri and Todd Anderson at Intuition Machines [built up](https://www.fastcompany.com/90377406/suspicious-of-googles-recaptcha-heres-a-popular-alternative) hCaptha, with an *h* for humans in three years to rival Google. Focusing on privacy, and re-inventing a business model, when they are actually paying for large webmasters to host their riddles, they created an ethical AI alternative that currently has a [15% global market share](https://www.hcaptcha.com/post/hcaptcha-now-the-largest-independent-captcha-service) in cybersecurity services.
