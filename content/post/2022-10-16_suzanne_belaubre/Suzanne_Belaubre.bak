INTERVIEW - SUZANNE BELAUBRE 

1. Where do you live? What places are important to you as a musician? If you had fans from distant lands, what would you recommend them to visit, see or hear?

I call “home” two places. I live in France, in Montreuil near Paris, and in Montauban near Toulouse. I like having two addresses, and travel inspires me in general.

As a musician, 3 types of places are important for me: my shelters - places where I can feel at home; the wild nature (forests, mountains, ocean...), and places with a lot of excitement like in Paris or in the capitals of the world.

If I had fans from distant countries I would recommend them to visit Paris for its character, the South of France for its vitality, and Brittany for its inspiring nature...

More precisely, I would advise them to go and listen to jazz jams, to go to concerts played in churches, at current music festivals, and in museums!

2. Where do you hope to find an audience for your music? If you could go on tour after the Covid-19 pandemic, which cities would be important stops for you?

I hope to find an audience in France, but also internationally, in Europe, Canada, and Japan for example. If I could go on tour I would gladly go to Berlin, Montreal, and London. These cities emit a musical aura in my eyes that interests me...

3. Can you feel local in a club, cafe, record store, or other location? What does it mean to you to be local?

I regularly go to the same bars and cafés, because I like to know what way the place will welcome me: what I'm going to get and which people I am going to meet there. Beyond that, I find it cool to be able to have a particular address. To be local for me is to be familiar with the customs: it gives me the impression of taking part in a dance.

4. (Daniel) I especially liked that your Open Studio Session was set in a CD store - I grew up in CD stores and my dad was a vinyl collector. What is your favorite music format?

I've always loved CDs, I always buy them and I'm happy to have a player still. I find that CDs look like gift boxes: you don't know what you'll find inside, how the artist took care of the visuals, and how he addresses the listeners.

And I prefer them to vinyl despite the sound quality of the latter, because CDs are smaller and cuter (laughs).

5. If someone talks in a cafe about the Spotify algorithm or YouTube recommendations, do you have an opinion on the subject as an artist or as a music lover? Do you know the algorithms that recommend music on different platforms?

I don't technically know the algorithms that recommend music on the different platforms but I have an opinion on the subject: personally, the Spotify algorithm suits me less than that of Youtube. I find that we quickly fall back on the same kind of sound and production, whereas I like somewhat experimental music. On YouTube, it happened I found myself binge-watching videos until 3:00 in the morning because the clips and the sounds fascinated me. This has never happened to me on any other platform...

6. How did you come across the Play to Rec series?

I discovered From Play to Rec by following the work of Jeremy Dunne, whom I had met during a live session filmed in Toulouse in February 2021. Jeremy is very talented and I admire his initiatives. So I was happy that he invited me to the MaMA!
